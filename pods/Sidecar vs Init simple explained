Understanding Init Containers & Sidecars in Kubernetes

Kubernetes uses Init Containers and Sidecars to improve how applications run in pods. Hereâ€™s a simple explanation:

Init Containers: These run before the main container and handle setup tasks like pulling configs or waiting for dependencies.

Sidecar Containers: These run alongside the main container to provide additional features like logging, monitoring, or proxying.

Use Case: A database app might use an init container to set up schema and a sidecar to collect logs.

Benefit: This approach keeps applications modular, scalable, and efficient.

Best Practice: Use init containers for one-time setup and sidecars for ongoing support tasks.
