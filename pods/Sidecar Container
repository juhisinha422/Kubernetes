🌟Do you know? What is a Sidecar Container?🌟

Remember Veeru and Jai from Sholay? 🏍️ Veeru drives the bike, but Jai helps along the way in the sidecar.

In DevOps, a sidecar container works the same way! The main container like Veeru does the heavy lifting, and the sidecar like Jai helps with extra tasks like logging, security, and monitoring.

Like "Yeh Dosti Hum Nahi Todenge", they work together to complete the job! - just like our favourite duo! 😎


Sidecar Container: -
================ 
Sometimes, along with the main container, we need an extra container to help it. This extra container is called a Sidecar Container. It runs alongside the main container and provides additional features to improve performance and functionality of main container without losing main containers quality and performance. 
Think of it like this: 
Main Container = Your application (e.g., a web server) 
Sidecar Container = A helper that manages logs, monitoring, or syncing data.



Why is a Sidecar Container needed? 
If your main container is designed to do only one job but needs extra features, instead of modifying it, you can add a Sidecar Container.
Example: If a container is running a web app, but you need to store log files, you can use a separate Sidecar Container for log storage.

Use Cases of Sidecar Containers 
• Log Management – To store and transfer logs
 • Security – To enhance the security of the main container 
• Proxy Server – To optimize networking 
• Data Backup & Sync – To send data to cloud or storage 
• Monitoring – To check the health of the container


Benefits of Sidecar Containers 
• You can add new features without modifying the main container
 • It improves microservices architecture 
• Helps create scalable and repeatable solutions
 • Makes logging, monitoring, and security easier
