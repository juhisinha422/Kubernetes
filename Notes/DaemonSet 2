Why DaemonSets exist — and why every Kubernetes cluster uses them

Not every workload needs multiple replicas.
Some workloads need one instance on every node.
That’s where DaemonSets come in.

What they do:
• Ensure a Pod runs on every node (or selected nodes).
• Automatically deploy new Pods when nodes join the cluster.
• Clean up Pods when nodes leave.

Where DaemonSets are used:
• logging agents (FluentD, FluentBit)
• monitoring agents (Prometheus node exporter, Datadog Agent)
• networking components (CNI plugins, kube-proxy)
• security/telemetry agents

Key benefit:
You never manually assign Pods to nodes — DaemonSets ensure they always exist everywhere they’re needed.

In simple words:
DaemonSets are Kubernetes’ way of saying “this Pod must live on every node.”
