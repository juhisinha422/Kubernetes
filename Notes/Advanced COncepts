advanced Kubernetes concepts. Hereâ€™s a quick recap of what I explored:
ðŸ”¹ Ingress: Learned how to expose HTTP/HTTPS routes to services, acting as a smart traffic router for clusters. Set up rules to manage external access with ease!
ðŸ”¹ Kubernetes Dashboard: Deployed and configured the official web-based UI. Now visualizing and managing cluster resources feels like a breeze.
ðŸ”¹ Pod Affinity & Anti-Affinity: Mastered controlling pod schedulingâ€”affinity to group pods for locality, anti-affinity to prevent co-location (great for high availability!).
ðŸ”¹ QoS (Quality of Service): Understood how Kubernetes prioritizes pods under resource constraints:
Guaranteed (highest priority)
Burstable (medium)
BestEffort (lowest)
