KIND?

 It stands for Kubernetes IN Docker, and itâ€™s one of the simplest ways to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally for testing and development.

Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s super useful:

âœ… Lightweight â€“ Runs Kubernetes clusters inside Docker containers

 âœ… Fast Setup â€“ No need for heavy VMs or cloud resources

 âœ… Great for Testing â€“ CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes experiments

 âœ… Developer Friendly â€“ Ideal for learning Kubernetes without extra infrastructure

KIND is not meant for production, but itâ€™s a game-changer for:

Learning Kubernetes commands and concepts

Testing Helm charts, manifests, and controllers

Running Kubernetes in CI 
environments

ðŸ’¡ I personally find it a great tool for quick cluster experiments before deploying to EKS, AKS, or GKE.
