Kubernetes Vs Docker swarm:::

✅ Kubernetes Architecture::

Key Components from the diagram:
	•	API Server → Acts as the control center for all operations.
	•	Controller Manager → Manages state changes and ensures the desired state is maintained.
	•	Scheduler → Assigns tasks to appropriate worker nodes based on availability.
	•	ETCD → Stores cluster data and configurations.
	•	Worker Nodes → Each node has:
	•	Kubelet → Communicates with the master node.
	•	Kube-proxy → Handles network traffic routing.
	•	Container Runtime → Runs containers (Docker or others).

✅ Analogy

Like running a global hotel chain:
	•	The API Server is the headquarters.
	•	The Controller Manager ensures every branch follows rules.
	•	The Scheduler assigns rooms to customers.
	•	The ETCD is like a centralized database with bookings.
	•	The worker nodes are individual hotels, each having their own staff and systems.

⸻

✅ Docker Swarm Architecture ::

Key Components from the diagram:
	•	CLI → Command interface to interact with the cluster.
	•	Swarm Manager → Controls the cluster and handles scheduling and state management.
	•	Service Discovery → Helps nodes find each other and communicate.
	•	Swarm Nodes → Run containers using Docker runtime.

✅ Analogy

Like running a small family café:
	•	The Swarm Manager is the owner coordinating tasks.
	•	Service Discovery is how the staff finds out what’s needed.
	•	The nodes are individual kitchen sections or branches with limited staff and simple workflows.
