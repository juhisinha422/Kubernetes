When deploying applications in Kubernetes, knowing the difference between Stateless, Stateful, and DaemonSet workloads is key to building reliable and scalable systems. Here's a quick breakdown:

🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
 These don't store any data about user sessions or past interactions. Every pod is identical, and you can easily scale up or down.
 📦 Examples: NGINX, REST APIs, frontend services.
 📌 Managed using Deployments or ReplicaSets.
🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
 These apps remember data even if the pod restarts. Each pod gets a stable identity, persistent storage, and ordered start/termination.
 🗂️ Examples: Databases like MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra.
 📌 Managed using StatefulSets.

🔹 𝗗𝗮𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗦𝗲𝘁: One Pod Per Node – No Exceptions
Used when you want a single copy of a pod on every node in the cluster. Great for running background services like log collectors, monitoring agents, or security daemons.
 🛠️ Examples: Fluentd, Prometheus Node Exporter, Filebeat.
 Ideal for background jobs that must run on every node, like monitoring and logging agents.

✅ 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗦𝗲𝘁
 • Node Affinity – Target specific nodes using labels (e.g., run only on workers).
 • Rolling Updates – Seamlessly update pods without downtime.
 • Resource Optimization – Deploy lightweight agents for essential services (e.g., Filebeat, Prometheus Node Exporter).

✅ 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗦𝗲𝘁 (𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘆):
kubectl create daemonset ds-name --image=image-name

kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml


💡 Pro Tip:
 Use Stateless where possible for simplicity and scalability. Use StatefulSets when each pod needs its own storage and identity. Use DaemonSets for node-level agents.
