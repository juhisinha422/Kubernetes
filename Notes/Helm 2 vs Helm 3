𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟮 𝘃𝘀 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟯 – 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲?

While working on Kubernetes deployments recently, I revisited 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 – the package manager for Kubernetes – and realized many still ask:

🧠 "𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟮 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟯?"

So here’s a quick breakdown that might help:

🆚 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟮 𝘃𝘀 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟯: 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀

🔒 𝗧𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 (𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁)
Helm 2 used Tiller (a server-side component) that had cluster-wide access — a major security concern.
👉 Helm 3 removed Tiller completely. Now everything runs client-side, respecting RBAC.

📦 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗥𝗗 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴
Helm 2 struggled with Custom Resource Definitions.
👉 Helm 3 separates CRDs and introduces CRD lifecycle management, making upgrades safer.

🔄 𝟯-𝗪𝗮𝘆 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆
Helm 3 introduces a 𝟯-𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 during upgrades (current, last applied, live).
👉 This prevents accidental overwrites and preserves user changes.

📜 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘀
In Helm 3, release information is stored as Kubernetes Secrets instead of ConfigMaps.
👉 More secure and aligned with best practices.

🧪 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗛𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 & 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀
Enhanced support for chart testing and better isolation of subchart values.

💬 If you're still using Helm 2, it’s definitely time to migrate!
Helm 3 is faster, safer, and built for modern Kubernetes environments.

 “𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘀 𝗞𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺? 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗜 𝘂𝘀𝗲?”

Let’s break it down. 👇

🆚 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝘃𝘀 𝗞𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 – 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀

📦 𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘃𝘀 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗮𝘆
 • Helm uses templating with Go templates (like variables + charts)
 • Kustomize uses YAML overlays — no templates, just declarative patching

🔧 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆
 • Helm supports packaging, releases, dependencies (great for sharing apps)
 • Kustomize is simpler — great for customizing existing YAML without extra tools

🔐 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁
 • Helm can package secrets (not encrypted unless external tools are used)
 • Kustomize doesn't manage secrets by default, but can integrate with tools like SOPS

🧪 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲

 • Use Helm for reusable apps with dynamic values (helm install my-app)
 • Use Kustomize when you want to keep plain YAML readable and customize per environment (kubectl apply -k)

🚀 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 = 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗿𝘁 + 𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴
📂 𝗞𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 = 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 + 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆

💬 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁?

For enterprise-grade deployments, Helm offers more features

For lightweight overlays, Kustomize keeps it clean and Kubernetes-native
