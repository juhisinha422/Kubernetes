𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟮 𝘃𝘀 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟯 – 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲?

While working on Kubernetes deployments recently, I revisited 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 – the package manager for Kubernetes – and realized many still ask:

🧠 "𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟮 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟯?"

So here’s a quick breakdown that might help:

🆚 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟮 𝘃𝘀 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝟯: 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀

🔒 𝗧𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 (𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁)
Helm 2 used Tiller (a server-side component) that had cluster-wide access — a major security concern.
👉 Helm 3 removed Tiller completely. Now everything runs client-side, respecting RBAC.

📦 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗥𝗗 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴
Helm 2 struggled with Custom Resource Definitions.
👉 Helm 3 separates CRDs and introduces CRD lifecycle management, making upgrades safer.

🔄 𝟯-𝗪𝗮𝘆 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆
Helm 3 introduces a 𝟯-𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 during upgrades (current, last applied, live).
👉 This prevents accidental overwrites and preserves user changes.

📜 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘀
In Helm 3, release information is stored as Kubernetes Secrets instead of ConfigMaps.
👉 More secure and aligned with best practices.

🧪 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗛𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 & 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀
Enhanced support for chart testing and better isolation of subchart values.

💬 If you're still using Helm 2, it’s definitely time to migrate!
Helm 3 is faster, safer, and built for modern Kubernetes environments.
