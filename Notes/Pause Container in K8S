✅*Pause Container in K8S*

✅ In Kubernetes, a *pause container* is a special type of container that is created and managed by the Kubernetes pod infrastructure. It's also known as the "pause" or "infra" container.

*Purpose:*

1. *Hold the network namespace*: The pause container holds the network namespace for the pod, allowing other containers in the pod to share the same network stack.
2. *Keep the pod running*: The pause container keeps the pod running, even if the main application container(s) exit or crash.
3. *Enable pod-level networking*: The pause container allows Kubernetes to manage pod-level networking, such as IP address allocation and port mapping.

*Characteristics:*

1. *Minimal image*: The pause container uses a minimal image, typically a few kilobytes in size.
2. *No application code*: The pause container doesn't run any application code.
3. *Runs indefinitely*: The pause container runs indefinitely, until the pod is deleted.

*How it works:*

1. When a pod is created, Kubernetes creates a pause container first.
2. The pause container is assigned an IP address and network namespace.
3. Other containers in the pod join the pause container's network namespace.
4. If the main application container(s) exit or crash, the pause container keeps the pod running.

*Example:*

You can see the pause container in a Kubernetes pod using `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`:
Containers:
 pause:
 Image: k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2
 Command: /pause
 ...
 my-app:
 Image: my-app-image
 ...

In this example, the `pause` container is the pause container, and `my-app` is the main application container.
