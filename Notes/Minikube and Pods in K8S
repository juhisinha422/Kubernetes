Diving into #Minikube & Pods with Kubernetes.

✅  What is Minikube?
🔹 Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes tool that lets you spin up a single-node cluster locally. Perfect for developers and testers, it offers a sandbox environment to:
➜Run a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine (Windows/macOS/Linux)
➜Emulate both Control Plane and Worker Node on the same machine
➜Experiment with new Kubernetes features before applying them in  production
➜Run your workloads using Docker or a VM as the driver
🧠 Best suited for learning, development, and prototyping — not recommended for production use.

⚙️ Minikube Requirements
Before setting up, ensure your system meets the basics:
🖥️ Minimum 2 CPUs
💾 20 GB disk space
🧠 At least 2 GB RAM
🌐 Active internet
🐳 Docker or a VM solution like VirtualBox

📦 Understanding Pods in Kubernetes:-
🔹 Pod is the smallest deployable unit in a Kubernetes cluster
📌 Think of it as a wrapper for one or more tightly coupled containers
🛠️ Containers inside a pod share the same IP, storage, and namespace
🔄 They can communicate with each other easily and share volumes
🎯 Kubernetes interacts with Pods, not individual containers

🛠️ How to Create Pods
🔸 Imperative Approach (CLI):
     ➜kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx
🔍 View Your Pod:
     ➜kubectl get pods
🔸 Declarative Approach (YAML):
      1. Create a file:
     ➜vim nginx-pod.yaml
2. Define your pod structure with:
   ✅apiVersion
   ✅kind: Pod
   ✅metadata: (name, labels)
   ✅spec: (image, ports, etc.)
3.  Apply the YAML:
  ➜kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
🔁 Pod Lifecycle Insight
⚠️ If a pod fails (due to memory, network issues, etc.), it will not restart by default.
 ✅ Use ReplicaSets or Deployments to automatically manage pod availability and ensure fault tolerance.

🧪 Practical Setup on AWS EC2
To simulate this in a cloud environment:
🚀 Launch an EC2 instance:
 Type: t2.medium | Storage: 25GB
🐧 Install Docker:
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker.io -y
🌐 Install Minikube:
minikube start --driver=docker --force
🧰 Install kubectl:
curl -LO https://lnkd.in/g2eNbSnC -s https://lnkd.in/gMBVmkAJ
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
kubectl version
🔥 Kubernetes is a vast ecosystem, but starting small with Minikube and Pods is the perfect way to build a strong foundation.
