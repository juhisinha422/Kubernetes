How Taints and Tolerations control Pod placement in Kubernetes

By default, Kubernetes tries to place Pods on any available node.
Taints and Tolerations let you control where Pods should NOT run.

Here’s how taints work:

1. A taint is applied to a node.
2. It marks the node as restricted.
3. Pods without a matching toleration cannot be scheduled there.

Taint effects:

1. NoSchedule
 a. Pod will not be scheduled on the node.
2. PreferNoSchedule
 a. Kubernetes avoids the node if possible.
3. NoExecute
 a. Existing Pods without toleration are evicted.

How tolerations work:

1. A toleration is added to a Pod.
2. It tells Kubernetes:
 “This Pod is allowed to run on tainted nodes.”
3. Only Pods with matching tolerations can be scheduled.

Common use cases:

1. Dedicated nodes for databases.
2. Isolating critical workloads.
3. GPU or special hardware nodes.
4. Preventing noisy neighbors.

In simple words:
Taints repel Pods.
Tolerations allow Pods to pass.

Together, they give you fine-grained control over Pod placement.
