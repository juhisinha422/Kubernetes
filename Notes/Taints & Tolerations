Kubernetes Taints & Tolerations â€” Keeping Your Cluster Organised

Taints and Tolerations work together in Kubernetes to control which Pods run on which Nodes, giving you greater flexibility and control over your cluster.

ðŸ”’ Taints are applied to Nodes. They act as a way to repel Pods, preventing them from being scheduled onto those Nodes unless the Pods explicitly tolerate the taint.

âœ… Tolerations are applied to Pods. They don't guarantee that a Pod will be scheduled onto a tainted Node, but they allow the scheduler to schedule the Pod there if other scheduling requirements are met.

Think of it like a "Staff Only" area in a restaurant, the Taint is the sign on the door, and the Toleration is like a staff badge. Only Pods with the right Toleration (badge) can enter; all others are restricted.

This helps ensure that sensitive workloads, special-purpose Nodes, or infrastructure-critical Nodes are properly isolated and that Pods don't get scheduled onto inappropriate Nodes.
