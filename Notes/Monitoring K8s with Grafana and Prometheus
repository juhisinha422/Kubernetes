Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus & Grafana ☸️🔍

Welcome back to our Kubernetes journey! Today, we dive into one of the most important aspects of any production environment: monitoring. And what better tools to use than Prometheus and Grafana — the go-to stack for cloud-native observability.


---

🔹 Why Monitoring Matters in K8s?

Kubernetes runs hundreds (or thousands) of microservices. Without monitoring, you’re flying blind. Monitoring:

Detects failures early ⚠️

Analyzes performance 📉

Helps with capacity planning 📦

Enables alerting and automation ⏰



---

🧠 What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source metrics collection and alerting system built for cloud-native environments.

✨ Key Features:

Pull-based metrics collection via HTTP endpoints

A powerful query language (PromQL) 🔎

Time-series data storage

Native Kubernetes service discovery

Built-in alert manager 📣


🔍 How It Works:

1. Prometheus scrapes metrics from targets like nodes, pods, and services.


2. It stores them as time-series data.


3. You can query this data or use it to trigger alerts.

📊 What is Grafana?

Grafana is a visualization tool that works with multiple data sources (including Prometheus) to create beautiful, dynamic dashboards.

✨ Key Features:

Intuitive dashboard building 📊

Alerting and notifications

Variable support for dynamic filtering

Permissions and sharing

Plugins for extra data sources

🔗 Prometheus + Grafana Workflow

1. Prometheus collects metrics from Kubernetes components:

kubelet

cAdvisor

kube-state-metrics

Application endpoints (like /metrics)



2. Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source.


3. You use Grafana to build dashboards, track CPU, memory, pod counts, network usage, and more.

🧩 Common Dashboards in Kubernetes

Cluster health overview 🌐

Node-level resource usage 📦

Pod-level memory/CPU graphs 📈

Service request rates & latency ⏱️

Alerting on pod restarts or threshold breaches 🚨

⚙️ Add-Ons to Know

kube-prometheus-stack: Helm chart that installs Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager, and exporters

Node Exporter: For collecting node-level OS metrics

kube-state-metrics: For Kubernetes object states (deployments, pods, etc.)

Alertmanager: Manages and routes alerts from Prometheus

🧠 Why Use Both?

Tool	Role

Prometheus	Collects & stores metrics
Grafana	Visualizes & analyzes data


Together, they provide full-stack observability — from infrastructure to applications.

Monitoring is not just a toolset — it’s a mindset. With Prometheus and Grafana in your arsenal, you can keep your Kubernetes clusters healthy, optimized, and future-ready! 🌟
