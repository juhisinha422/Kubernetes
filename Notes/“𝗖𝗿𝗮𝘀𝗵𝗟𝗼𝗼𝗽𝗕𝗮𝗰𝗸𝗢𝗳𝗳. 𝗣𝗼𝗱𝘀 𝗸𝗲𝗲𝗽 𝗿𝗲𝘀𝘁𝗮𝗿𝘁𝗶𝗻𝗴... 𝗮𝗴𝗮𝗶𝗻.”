Ever deployed a service on Kubernetes — and watched the pods go into a crash-loop? 😬

🔹 App errors or misconfigurations inside the container
🔹 Strict or incorrect liveness/readiness probes
🔹 Resource limits (memory / CPU) too tight — causing OOM or failure under load
🔹 Broken or wrong container image / config / secrets / environment variables
🔹 External dependencies (DB / API / volume mount / network) not available or mis-configured

What I love (and also hate) about Kubernetes: it tries to handle failures automatically — restart, retry, back-off. But it also forces you to learn fast: logs + probes + configs + resource profiles.
