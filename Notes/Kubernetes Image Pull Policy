Kubernetes Image Pull Policyl Policy in simple words

The imagePullPolicy in Kubernetes defines how images are pulled to nodes during Pod creation or updates.

Options:

𝗜𝗳𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁: Pulls the image only if it’s not already on the node.
𝗔𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: Always pulls the image from the registry.
𝗡𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿: Never pulls; uses only locally available images.

Default behavior:

If the tag is :latest → policy defaults to Always
If a tag other than :latest is used → IfNotPresent
If no tag is specified → Kubernetes assumes :latest and sets Always

✅ Best practice: Always specify both an image tag and the imagePullPolicy explicitly to ensure consistent deployments.
