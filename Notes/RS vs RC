ReplicaSet vs ReplicationController

If you're diving into Kubernetes, you might come across both ReplicaSet and ReplicationController.

What’s the difference?

1. ReplicaSet is the modern replacement for ReplicationController.
2. ReplicationController is outdated but still supported for legacy use.
3. ReplicaSet supports set-based label selectors (e.g., "key in [value1, value2]"), making it more flexible.
4. Deployments use ReplicaSets under the hood, enabling rolling updates and easy rollbacks.
5. If you’re using ReplicationController, it’s time to upgrade to ReplicaSet or better – use Deployments!

Bottom Line:
ReplicationController walked so ReplicaSet could run – but now, Deployments are the standard for managing pod replicas efficiently.
