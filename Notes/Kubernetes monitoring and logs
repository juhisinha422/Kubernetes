When your applications run on Kubernetes, visibility is everything. You need to know what’s happening inside your pods and containers — and that’s where monitoring and logs step in.

🔧 Application Logs
Use:
𝘬𝘶𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘭 𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘴 -𝘧 <𝘱𝘰𝘥-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦>
This command helps you view real-time logs, troubleshoot errors, and understand application behavior — no extra tool needed!

📈 Monitoring
Tools like:
𝘔𝘦𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘴 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦𝘳 for resource usage (CPU, memory)
𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘶𝘴 + 𝘎𝘳𝘢𝘧𝘢𝘯𝘢 for dashboards & alerting
𝘌𝘓𝘒 𝘚𝘵𝘢𝘤𝘬 / 𝘓𝘰𝘬𝘪 for advanced log management

✅ With these, you can answer:
Is my app using too much memory?
Why did a pod crash?
What’s slowing down my service?

🎯 Whether you're debugging a failed deployment or scaling based on load, observability helps you stay in control.
