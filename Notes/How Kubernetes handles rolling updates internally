How Kubernetes handles rolling updates internally

Rolling updates allow Kubernetes to update applications
without taking everything down at once.

Here’s what actually happens during a rolling update:

1. You update the Deployment (image, config, or version).
2. Kubernetes creates a NEW ReplicaSet with the updated Pod template.
3. New Pods are started gradually based on rollout settings.
4. Old Pods are terminated one by one.
5. At no point does Kubernetes bring down all Pods together.

Key rollout controls:

1. maxUnavailable
 a. Maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during update.
2. maxSurge
 a. Extra Pods Kubernetes can create temporarily.
3. readiness probes
 a. Ensure traffic goes only to healthy Pods.

Why rolling updates are reliable:

1. Traffic is shifted gradually.
2. Failed Pods stop the rollout automatically.
3. Easy rollback to the previous ReplicaSet.
4. No downtime for stateless services.

Common mistakes:

1. Missing readiness probes.
2. Setting maxUnavailable too high.
3. Assuming rolling updates work for stateful apps the same way.

In simple words:
Rolling updates replace Pods slowly and safely,
keeping your application available throughout the update.
