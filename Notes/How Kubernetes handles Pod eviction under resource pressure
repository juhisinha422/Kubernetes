How Kubernetes handles Pod eviction under resource pressure

When a node starts running out of CPU, memory, or disk,
Kubernetes must protect the node and the cluster.

That’s when Pod eviction happens.

Here’s how eviction works:

1. kubelet monitors node conditions:
 a. MemoryPressure
 b. DiskPressure
 c. PIDPressure

2. When pressure crosses safe limits:
 a. kubelet triggers eviction
 b. Pods are terminated to free resources

Eviction order is NOT random:

1. BestEffort Pods are evicted first.
2. Burstable Pods are evicted next.
3. Guaranteed Pods are evicted last.

Other factors considered:

1. Pod priority.
2. PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs).
3. Graceful termination periods.
4. Critical system Pods are protected.

Why this matters:

1. Prevents node crashes.
2. Keeps the cluster stable.
3. Highlights why proper requests and limits are critical.
4. Explains many “unexpected” Pod restarts in production.

In simple words:
When a node is under stress, Kubernetes sacrifices low-priority Pods
to keep the system alive.
