Kubernetes Autoscaling: 

𝐇𝐏𝐀 𝐯𝐬 𝐕𝐏𝐀 𝐯𝐬 𝐊𝐄𝐃𝐀-What’s the Difference? 🚀

If you're working in a cloud-native environment, understanding how your workloads scale is critical for both performance and cost efficiency.

Here’s a visual breakdown of:

 🔹 HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) – scales the number of pods based on metrics like CPU or memory.

 🔸 VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) – adjusts the resource requests/limits of existing pods.

 🟢 KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler) – scales based on custom event sources like Kafka, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, etc.

💡 Use HPA for responsive horizontal scaling, VPA for tuning pod resources, and KEDA when you want scaling to react to real-world event triggers. Often, combining these can create smart, efficient autoscaling strategies.
