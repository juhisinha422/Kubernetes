What makes Kubernetes a self-healing system?
One of Kubernetes’ biggest strengths is its ability to fix things on its own.
Here’s how self-healing works:
• The desired state is stored in etcd.
• Controllers continuously check the actual state.
• When something goes wrong — pod crash, node failure, restart, drift —
 Kubernetes automatically corrects it by:
 • recreating Pods
 • rescheduling workloads
 • restarting containers
 • replacing replicas
No human intervention — just reconciliation loops doing their job.

Why this matters:
• Higher availability
• Faster recovery
• Less manual operational effort
• Predictable behavior

In simple words:
Kubernetes heals itself because controllers constantly detect gaps and fix them based on the desired state.
