How does a Kubernetes Pod actually get its IP?

When a Pod starts, it feels like magic — an IP appears inside eth0 instantly. But behind that is a very smart workflow handled by the node, not the control plane.

Every node in the cluster gets its own Pod subnet (podCIDR). When a Pod lands on a node, the IP is simply picked from that node’s local subnet.

As soon as kubelet creates the Pod sandbox, it calls the CNI plugin. This plugin is responsible for everything: creating a network namespace, assigning an IP, and wiring the Pod into the cluster network.

The CNI plugin creates a veth pair — one end goes inside the Pod, one stays on the node. Routing rules are added so the Pod can talk to services and other pods across nodes.

The Pod just wakes up, sees eth0, and starts working like a tiny Linux machine with its own IP stack.
