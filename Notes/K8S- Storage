Kubernetes Storage: PV, PVC & StorageClass Simplified 📦

🔹 1. Persistent Volume (PV)
 A PV is a piece of storage in the K8s cluster that has been provisioned by an admin or dynamically via StorageClass.
 It's like a pre-configured "USB drive" plugged into the cluster.
pv.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
 name: my-pv
spec:
 capacity:
 storage: 10Gi
 accessModes:
 - ReadWriteMany
 PersistentvolumeClaimPolicy: Retain
 hostPath:
 path: "/mnt/data"

🔹 2. Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
 A PVC is a request by a user for storage. It’s like asking, “I need 5Gi of storage with ReadWriteOnce access.”
Kubernetes matches this request with an available PV (if it fits).
pvc.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: my-pvc
spec:
 accessModes:
 - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
 requests:
 storage: 5Gi

💡 PVCs decouple your app from the actual storage backend, making it portable!

🔹 3. StorageClass – The Magic of Dynamic Provisioning ✨
 Want Kubernetes to automatically provision storage on demand? Enter StorageClass!
This defines how the storage should be dynamically provisioned (e.g., SSDs, HDDs, NFS, cloud volumes).
sc.yaml

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
 type: gp2

PVCs can then reference a StorageClass:
pvc.yaml

spec:
 storageClassName: fast

📊 Flow Summary
 1️⃣ You define a StorageClass (optional, but enables dynamic provisioning).
 2️⃣ Your app defines a PVC requesting storage.
 3️⃣ Kubernetes either finds a matching PV, or dynamically provisions one using the StorageClass.
 4️⃣ The PVC gets bound to the PV, and your pod can now mount it!

🔁 Why it matters:
PVCs keep your storage needs declarative & app-specific
PVs abstract the actual hardware
StorageClasses let you scale storage like a pro 🌩️
