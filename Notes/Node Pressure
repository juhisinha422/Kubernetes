Node Pressure in Kubernetes 

What You Need to Know
When a Kubernetes node runs low on critical resources — like CPU, memory, disk space, or inodes.

the kubelet detects this and raises node pressure conditions:

⚠️ MemoryPressure
⚠️ DiskPressure
⚠️ PIDPressure
⚠️ InodePressure

Why does this matter?
 When a node is under pressure, Kubernetes:
 
Prioritizes system stability
Starts evicting low-priority pods to free up resources
Helps prevent the entire node from becoming unresponsive

What can you do?
 Design pod resource requests/limits carefully
 Monitor node health (e.g. kubectl describe node)
 Use taints/tolerations and pod priorities to control eviction behavior
 Scale the cluster or optimize workloads proactively

💬 “Node pressure is Kubernetes’ way of telling you: your infrastructure needs attention before it’s too late.”
