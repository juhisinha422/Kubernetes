Deploying Kubernetes with Kops ☁️⚙️


---

🔹 What is Kops?

Kops (Kubernetes Operations) is an open-source tool that automates the creation, configuration, and management of Kubernetes clusters on cloud providers — most notably AWS.

Think of Kops as the "kubectl" for cluster management:
It helps you provision, upgrade, and maintain Kubernetes clusters with ease.


---

✅ Why Use Kops?

Creates highly available, production-ready Kubernetes clusters.

Automates networking, DNS, IAM roles, VPCs, etc.

Supports cluster upgrades and rolling updates.

Built-in backup, restore, and validation tools.

Ideal for AWS, with some support for other platforms like GCP and bare metal.

⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

AWS account and access credentials.

A registered domain name (e.g., example.com) or use a subdomain.

kubectl installed.

Kops CLI installed.

AWS CLI installed.

🪜 STEP 1: Create a s3 bucket for storage in AWS:

AWS s3 mb s3://teja.k8s.local

export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://teja.k8s.local

🪜 STEP2: Create cluster: Taking 1 master and 2 node machines.

kops create cluster --name mycluster.k8s.local --zones us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c --master-size t3.medium --master-count 1 --master-volume-size 28 --node-size t3.micro --node-count 2 --node-volume-size 28

🪜 STEP3:
Writing the manifest file for creation of POD
and use command
kubectl create -f manifestfile.yml

🪜 STEP4:
Writing the manifest file for creation of service to expose the application.

Attaching the POD manifest file will deep dive into Services and exposing of application tomorrow.

We can check the created pods whether they are created in our cluster or not using 
kubectl describe podname.

Don't forget to delete the cluster. Use:
kops delete cluster --name clustername --yes

📝 Summary

Today, you learned:

What Kops is and why it's useful for cloud-based Kubernetes clusters.

How to prepare DNS and S3 storage.

How to create, and manage a cluster with Kops.


Kops makes it easier to go from "zero to production-ready cluster" in minutes on AWS.
