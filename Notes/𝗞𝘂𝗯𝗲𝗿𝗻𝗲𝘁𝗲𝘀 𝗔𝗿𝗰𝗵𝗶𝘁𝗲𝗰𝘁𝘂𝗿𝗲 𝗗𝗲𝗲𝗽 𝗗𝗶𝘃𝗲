Kubernetes has become the backbone of modern infrastructure — but how does it actually work under the hood? Let’s break it down. 👇

🧠 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐍𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬 (𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐞)
The brain of the operation:
🔹 API Server
 Acts as the gateway for all requests – the central hub where Kubernetes tasks begin. It exposes the Kubernetes API and ensures requests are validated and processed.
🔹 Scheduler
 Decides where each pod should run based on available resources – optimizing workload distribution.
🔹 Controller Manager
 Ensures the desired cluster state is always maintained. If something goes wrong, it fixes it.
Includes:
Node Controller
Replication Controller
Endpoints Controller
Service Account & Token Controllers
🔹 etcd
 A consistent and highly available key-value store holding all cluster data. It’s the single source of truth for your Kubernetes cluster.

💪 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐍𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬 (𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬)
The muscle of your cluster, where your apps actually run:
🔹 Kubelet – Ensures containers are running as instructed
🔹 Pods – The smallest deployable units (one or more containers)
🔹 Kube Proxy – Handles networking between pods and services
🔹 Container Runtime – Runs the containers (e.g., Docker, containerd)

🔍 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬:
1. Self-Managed (DIY Infrastructure):
Minikube – Great for local testing
Kubeadm, K3D, KOPS – Suitable for more complex setups
2. Cloud-Managed (Provider Managed):
AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
GCP GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)


💡 Why It Matters
Kubernetes’ modular design automates scaling, healing, and deploying apps—so you can focus on code, not infrastructure!
👉 Fun Fact: The Control Plane’s controllers (Node, Replication, Endpoints) silently fix issues to keep your apps running smoothly.
