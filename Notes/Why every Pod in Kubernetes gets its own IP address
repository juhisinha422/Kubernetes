Why every Pod in Kubernetes gets its own IP address

Kubernetes networking follows a simple but powerful rule:
“Every Pod gets a unique IP, and all Pods can talk to each other without NAT.”

Here’s why this design exists:

1. Pods are treated like standalone network endpoints.
2. Each Pod gets its own network namespace and virtual Ethernet interface.
3. The CNI plugin (Calico, Cilium, Flannel, etc.) assigns the Pod a unique IP.
4. Pod-to-Pod communication works directly across nodes because:
   a. CNI sets routing rules
   b. No NAT is required
   c. Every Pod is reachable flat across the cluster
5. When a Pod dies, its IP dies with it — a new Pod gets a new IP.

Why Kubernetes does this:

1. Simplifies distributed application communication.
2. Makes service discovery easier.
3. Avoids port conflicts between containers.
4. Works reliably across multi-node clusters.
5. Allows network policies and service meshes to work cleanly.

In simple words:
Each Pod gets its own IP because Kubernetes treats Pods like independent machines in a flat, virtual network.
