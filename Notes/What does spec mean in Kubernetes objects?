 What does spec mean in Kubernetes objects? 💥 
spec = the desired state of the object.
It defines what you want Kubernetes to create, manage, or maintain inside that object.
⭐ spec tells Kubernetes what should exist inside that particular kind

Simple Memory Trick
Think of it like this:
metadata = who am I?
(name, labels)
spec = what should I do?
(desired behavior)
status = what is happening right now?
(Kubernetes automatically fills this, not you)
