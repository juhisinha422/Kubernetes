Kubernetes Service to Pod Request Flow

Here is what happens when you try to access application using Kubernetes ClusterIP service:
1. User/Client sends a DNS query for the Kubernetes service name.
2. CoreDNS/kube-dns resolves the service name and returns the ClusterIP.
3. User/Client connects to the Service’s ClusterIP on the specified port.
4. Service receives the request and uses its selector to identify matching pods.
5. Endpoints resource lists the IPs of pods that match the Service selector.
6. kube-proxy watches Services and Endpoints and sets up iptables/netrules to route traffic.
7. Bridge Network (e.g., cni0 or flannel.1) handles routing on the node.
8. Traffic is sent to the veth pair (host side) to reach the target pod.
9. Traffic enters the pod’s network namespace via the veth pair (pod side).
10. The Pod receives the request on its containerPort (e.g., 8080).
