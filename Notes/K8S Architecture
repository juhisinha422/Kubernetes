What is Kubernetes?  
Kubernetes is an open‑source, robust container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

🛠 Uses of Kubernetes:  
• Container Orchestration: Seamlessly deploys and schedules containerized applications.  
• Dynamic Scaling & Load Balancing: Adjusts computing resources in real‑time to match demand fluctuations.  
• Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks: Facilitates smooth updates and rapid recovery from any issues.  
• Resource Optimization: Maximizes infrastructure efficiency through intelligent workload distribution.  
• Fault Tolerance: Ensures high availability by maintaining continuous operation even under failure.

⚙️ Kubernetes Architecture:  
Kubernetes operates on a dual‑structure model comprised of two main components:

Control Plane (Master Node):  
– API Server: Serves as the secure gateway for all cluster commands and communications.  
– Scheduler: Strategically assigns Pods to optimal worker nodes based on resource availability and policy constraints.  
– Controller Manager: Oversees controller loops that reconcile the cluster’s actual state with its desired configuration.  
– etcd: A dependable distributed key‑value store that safeguards configuration and state data.

Worker Nodes:  
– Pods: The fundamental deployable units that encapsulate one or more containers running your applications.  
– Kubelet: An agent that ensures containers run exactly as specified within each Pod.  
– kube‑proxy: Manages network rules to enable smooth internal and external traffic flow.
