 Kubernetes Cluster Setup – From kubeadm to Cloud Options ⚙️
Yesterday, we unpacked Kubernetes fundamentals. Today, we’re getting hands-on with cluster setups—ranging from bare metal to cloud-native solutions. Let’s go! 🚀

🔧 1️⃣ Production Setup with kubeadm
Ideal for on-prem or when you need full control:

🔹 Disable swap & configure hostnames

🔹 Install container runtime (e.g., containerd)

🔹 Run kubeadm init to initialize the control plane

🔹 Use kubeadm join to add worker nodes

🔹 Deploy a CNI plugin (Flannel, Calico, etc.)

💡 Pro Tip: Save your kubeadm join token securely—essential for scaling!

⚙️ 2️⃣ Alternative Cluster Setup Options
Different use cases, different tools:

🧪 Minikube / Kind – Great for local testing in Docker

🧊 k3s – Lightweight (<40MB), perfect for edge/IoT

🧰 Kubespray – Ansible-based for production-grade setups

☁️ EKS / AKS / GKE – Managed Kubernetes in the cloud

📌 3️⃣ Key Considerations

🔸 k3s runs on 512MB RAM, kubeadm requires 2GB+

🔸 CNI choice directly affects networking performance

🔸 Tools like k0s offer built-in encryption and simplicity

🛠️ Troubleshooting Tip: If nodes show NotReady, check:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get pods -A 
journalctl -u kubelet
Common culprits: CNI issues or cert errors
