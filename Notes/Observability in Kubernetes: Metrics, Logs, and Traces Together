Observability in Kubernetes: Metrics, Logs, and Traces Together

Monitoring alone isn’t enough in Kubernetes. True observability combines metrics, logs, and traces to help teams understand what’s happening and why.

Each signal plays a role:
- Metrics - What’s slow or broken
- Logs - What actually happened
- Traces - Where time is spent across services
When these signals are connected, teams debug faster, reduce MTTR, and gain confidence in complex systems.

Observability isn’t a tool; it’s a capability.
