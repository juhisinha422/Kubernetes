Prometheus Monitoring: Complete Setup & Best Practices

❇️ Prometheus has become the de facto standard for monitoring cloud-native applications and infrastructure, offering metrics collection, querying, and integration with visualization tools.

❇️ What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit originally developed at SoundCloud in 2012 and now a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project. It’s specifically designed for reliability and scalability in dynamic cloud environments, making it the go-to solution for monitoring microservices, containers, and Kubernetes clusters.

❇️ Key Features
   
   ▪️ Time-Series Database: Prometheus stores all data as time-series, identified by metric names and key-value pairs (labels), enabling flexible and powerful querying capabilities.

    ▪️ Pull-Based Model: Unlike traditional push-based systems, Prometheus actively scrapes metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, making it more reliable and easier to configure.

    ▪️ PromQL Query Language: A powerful functional query language allows you to slice and dice your metrics data in real-time, performing aggregations, transformations, and complex calculations.

    ▪️ Service Discovery: Automatic discovery of monitoring targets through various mechanisms including Kubernetes, Consul, EC2, and static configurations.
   
     ▪️ No External Dependencies: Prometheus operates as a single binary with no required external dependencies, simplifying deployment and reducing operational complexity.

    ▪️ Built-in Alerting: AlertManager handles alerts from Prometheus, providing deduplication, grouping, and routing to notification channels like email, PagerDuty, or Slack.
