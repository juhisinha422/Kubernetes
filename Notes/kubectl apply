What Happens When You Run kubectl apply?

kubectl apply is the command you use to send your desired configuration to the Kubernetes API server. It's the primary way to create and update resources in your cluster.

When you run kubectl apply, Kubernetes:
- Reads your YAML file.
- Sends the desired state to the Kubernetes API server.
- Kubernetes compares desired vs current state.
- Makes changes to match your desired state.

This is called declarative managementâ€”you define what you want, Kubernetes makes it happen.
