Static Pods are managed directly by the Kubelet, not the Kubernetes Control Plane (no scheduler, controller, or API server involvement).

🔹 𝙒𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙮 𝙙𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙙?
Simply drop your pod manifest into:
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/
...and Kubelet will auto-create the pod ✨

🔹 𝙒𝙝𝙮 𝙪𝙨𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙢?
 • Great for running system-level components (like kube-proxy, CoreDNS)
 • Useful when you want tight control over pod placement
 • Pods auto-restart if killed or the node reboots

🔹 𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙥 𝙤𝙣𝙚?
Just delete the manifest from the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ directory, and Kubelet will handle the cleanup.

💡 Pro Tip: You’ll see these static pods as mirror pods via kubectl get pods -A, but you can’t delete them using kubectl — you have to manage them from the node directly.
