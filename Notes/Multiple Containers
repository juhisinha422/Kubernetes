Multiple Containers in a Kubernetes Pod â€“ Debugging Tips

In Kubernetes, a Pod can have multiple containers:
- Usually one main container runs the application
- Optional sidecar containers handle tasks like logging, metrics, or proxies

* Debugging a Container inside a Pod
- Suppose you have a Pod with two containers: app and logger. You can enter a specific container using:

kubectl exec -it mypod -c app -- /bin/bash
* mypod â†’ Pod name
* -c app â†’ Container name inside the Pod
* /bin/bash â†’ Start a shell for debugging

Check Pod Resources
- You can also see CPU/memory usage per Pod:

kubectl top pod mypod

ðŸ’¡ Takeaways:
Pods can hold multiple containers, but usually one main + optional sidecars
