How kubelet ensures your Pod is always running

The kubelet is the node agent that makes sure whatever the API server “wants” is actually happening on the node.
Here’s how it works:
 • It continuously watches the API server for Pod specs assigned to its node.
 • It checks the actual state of containers via the container runtime (containerd/CRI-O).
 • If a container stops, crashes, or becomes unhealthy, kubelet automatically:
     • restarts it
     • kills it if it’s stuck
     • recreates it based on the Pod definition
 • It runs health checks (liveness/readiness/startup probes) and reacts accordingly.
 • It reports node status, pod status, and resource usage back to the API server.

Key point:
The kubelet never decides what to run — it only ensures the node matches the desired state defined by the API server.

In simple words:
kubelet is the “executor” of Kubernetes — it watches, reports, corrects, and keeps your Pods alive.
