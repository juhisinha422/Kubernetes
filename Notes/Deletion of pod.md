How a Pod is deleted in Kubernetes (behind the scenes).

ðŸ”Ž Step-by-Step: What Happens When a Pod is Deleted in Kubernetes

1. User Deletes Pod

	â€¢	Command executed:

kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

	â€¢	This sends a delete request to the Kubernetes API Server.

â¸»

2. API Server Updates ETCD

	â€¢	The API Server writes the podâ€™s deletionTimestamp and deletionGracePeriodSeconds into etcd.

	â€¢	Podâ€™s status becomes Terminating.

â¸»

3. Endpoint Controller Removes Pod from Endpoints

	â€¢	The Endpoint Controller updates the Endpoints object (removes the podâ€™s IP).

	â€¢	This change propagates to:

	â€¢	Kube-Proxy

	â€¢	iptables

	â€¢	Ingress

	â€¢	CoreDNS

	â€¢	This ensures no new traffic is sent to the terminating pod.

4. Kubelet Gets Notified

	â€¢	The API Server notifies the kubelet running on the node where the pod is scheduled.

	â€¢	Kubelet initiates pod termination.

â¸»

5. PreStop Hook (Optional)

	â€¢	If a PreStop Hook is defined, kubelet executes it.

	â€¢	Example: Closing database connections, draining requests, etc.
	
â€¢	Default timeout: 10 seconds.

â¸»

6. SIGTERM Signal

	â€¢	After PreStop hook (or immediately if not defined), kubelet sends a SIGTERM signal to the podâ€™s main container process.

	â€¢	This gives the application a chance to gracefully shut down.

â¸»

7. Grace Period

	â€¢	Pod has up to terminationGracePeriodSeconds (default 30s) to shut down gracefully.

	â€¢	During this period:

	â€¢	App should stop serving requests

	â€¢	Clean up resources (e.g., flush logs, close connections)

â¸»

8. SIGKILL (Forced Termination)

	â€¢	If pod does not exit after the grace period, kubelet sends SIGKILL to forcefully terminate the container.

â¸»

9. Pod Deleted

	â€¢	Kubelet notifies API Server that the pod has been terminated.

	â€¢	API Server removes pod entry from etcd.

	â€¢	Pod state becomes Deleted.

â¸»

âš¡ Timeline Example (Based on Image)
	â€¢	PreStop Hook timeout: 10s
	â€¢	Graceful shutdown after SIGTERM: 10s

	â€¢	Total max time before SIGKILL: ~20s (if app doesnâ€™t exit itself).

âœ… In summary:

kubectl delete pod â†’ API Server â†’ ETCD â†’ Endpoint Controller â†’ Remove from service/endpoints â†’ Kubelet notified â†’ PreStop Hook â†’ SIGTERM â†’ Graceful Shutdown â†’ SIGKILL (if needed) â†’ Pod Deleted.
