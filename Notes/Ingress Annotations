Kubernetes Tip ✍ : Simplifying Ingress Routing using Ingress Annotations

K8s Ingress annotations are key-value pairs added to the metadata of an ingress resource. They allow to customize behavior when using specific Ingress controllers like NGINX, HAProxy, etc....

Some of the commonly used NGINX Ingress annotations are:
➡️ rewrite-target: Target URI where the traffic must be redirected.
➡️ use-regex: Indicates if the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions.
➡️ ssl-redirect & force-ssl-redirect: Secure the endpoints with auto HTTPS redirects
➡️ proxy-body-size: Handle large file uploads gracefully

Use Case 🗒️ : API Gateway Routing in Kubernetes
 
Suppose we have a backend service (user-service) running inside k8s. The goal is to :
1️⃣ Route incoming traffic from /api/users/... to this service
2️⃣ Strip the /api prefix before forwarding(rewrite the path)
2️⃣ Enforce HTTPS redirection
4️⃣ Support large file uploads

#annotation.yaml file
.....
annotations:
 nginx.ingress.kubernetes[.]io/rewrite-target: /$1
 nginx.ingress.kubernetes[.]io/use-regex: "true"
 nginx.ingress.kubernetes[.]io/ssl-redirect: "true"
 nginx.ingress.kubernetes[.]io/proxy-body-size: "50m"
.....
Explanation 👇 :
🔸rewrite-target: /$1 -> rewrites /api/users/profile -> /users/profile
🔸use-regex: "true" -> allow path pattern matching
🔸ssl-redirect: "true" -> automatically redirects to HTTPS
🔸proxy-body-size: "50m" -> enables large uploads without a error
