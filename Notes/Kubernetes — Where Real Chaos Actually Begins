Kubernetes — Where Real Chaos Actually Begins

Running Kubernetes in production isn’t just deployments and YAML files… it’s a battlefield where only real engineers survive! ⚔️🚀
Here are the REAL issues you’ll face when K8s goes wild:
🔸 CrashLoopBackOff
 Misconfigured env vars, faulty init containers, or apps failing to reach DB.
🔸 OOMKilled
 Pod memory limits too strict — your app gets mercilessly killed.
🔸 Node Not Ready
 Disk pressure, network plugin crashes, or kernel-level issues.
🔸 Pod stuck in Pending
 NodeSelector, taints, or tolerations not aligned.
🔸 High etcd Latency
 Large clusters, oversized objects, or missing compaction.
🔸 DNS failures inside pods
 CoreDNS crashes, throttling, or CNI misconfigurations.
🔸 Services not reachable
 Wrong selectors, bad endpoints, or incorrect Service type.
🔸 HPA not scaling
 Metrics-server missing, wrong metrics API, or slow scrape intervals.
🔸 PVC stuck in Pending
 StorageClass mismatch or provisioner unavailable.
🔸 Pods evicted
 Node resource pressure — CPU, memory, or disk.
🔸 ImagePullBackOff
 Incorrect tags or failing registry authentication.
🔸 Liveness/Readiness probe failures
 App not ready or misconfigured probe endpoints.
🔸 NetworkPolicy blocking traffic
 Too-restrictive ingress/egress rules.
🔸 Ingress not routing
 Missing annotations, wrong pathType, or backend mismatches.
🔸 ConfigMap updates not reflecting
 Pods need a restart — mounted volumes don’t hot-reload.
🔥 Kubernetes isn’t hard — it’s brutally honest.
 If you want to grow as a DevOps or SRE engineer, this is the playground.
 If you can survive here… you can survive anywhere. 😄
