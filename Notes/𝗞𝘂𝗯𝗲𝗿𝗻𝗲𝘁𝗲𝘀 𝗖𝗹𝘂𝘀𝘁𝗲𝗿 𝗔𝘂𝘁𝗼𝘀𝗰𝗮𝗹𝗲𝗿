When Pods can’t be scheduled due to lack of node resources, scaling Pods alone isn’t enough — the cluster itself must grow. That’s where Cluster Autoscaler comes in.

🧠 What Cluster Autoscaler does?
• Automatically adds nodes when Pods are pending
• Removes unused nodes when capacity is no longer needed
• Works with cloud provider auto-scaling groups

👉 It ensures your cluster always has just enough infrastructure.

⚙️ How it works (simple)?
• Watches for unschedulable Pods
• Checks which node groups can host them
• Increases node count when needed
• Removes nodes that are underutilized

👉 It runs in a continuous decision loop.
🆚 Cluster Autoscaler vs HPA

• HPA → scales Pods
• Cluster Autoscaler → scales Nodes
📌 Both are required for true elasticity.

📊 Why it matters in production
• Prevents failed deployments
• Reduces cloud cost
• Handles traffic spikes
• Enables large-scale workloads
