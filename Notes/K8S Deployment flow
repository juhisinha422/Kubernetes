90% of DevOps engineers know how to deploy. Only 10% know what happens under the hood.”

Everyone knows how to run kubectl apply.
But what happens under the hood is where real engineers are made.
So let’s break it down 👇

🔄 The K8s Deployment Flow:
📥 API Server – Receives your request and validates it
📦 etcd – Stores your spec as the “desired state”
🧮 Scheduler – Chooses the best node to run your pod
🎮 Controller Manager – Reconciles actual vs desired state
🧱 Kubelet – Talks to the node, pulls your pod spec
🔧 Container Runtime – Actually runs the container (e.g., containerd)
🌐 Kube Proxy – Handles traffic routing via iptables/IPVS
🧭 CoreDNS – Resolves service names like my-svc.default.svc.cluster.local
📊 Metrics Server – Reports usage to HPA and dashboards


💡 Every time you deploy, this flow quietly works behind the scenes.
But when something breaks —
You'd better know where in the flow to look.
