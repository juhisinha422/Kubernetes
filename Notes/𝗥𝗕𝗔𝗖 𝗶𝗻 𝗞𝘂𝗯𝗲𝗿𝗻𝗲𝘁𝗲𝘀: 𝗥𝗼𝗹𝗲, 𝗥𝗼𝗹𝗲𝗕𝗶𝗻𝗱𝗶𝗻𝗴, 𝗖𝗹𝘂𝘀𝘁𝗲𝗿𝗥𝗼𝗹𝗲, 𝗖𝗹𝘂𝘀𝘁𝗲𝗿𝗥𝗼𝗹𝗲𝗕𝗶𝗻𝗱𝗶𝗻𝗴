RBAC = Role-Based Access Control.

It works using 4 core objects:

1️⃣ Role
Defines permissions inside a specific namespace.

Example:
Allow create + list pods in “dev”.

2️⃣ ClusterRole
Defines permissions cluster-wide.

Example:
Allow listing nodes.

3️⃣ RoleBinding
Attaches a Role to:
• User
• Group
• ServiceAccount

Inside a namespace.

4️⃣ ClusterRoleBinding
Attaches a ClusterRole cluster-wide.

Important logic:

No binding → No permission.

Roles define what can be done.
Bindings define who can do it.

That’s it.

RBAC is just structured permission mapping.
