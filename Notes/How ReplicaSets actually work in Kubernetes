How ReplicaSets actually work in Kubernetes

A ReplicaSet’s job is simple but critical:
make sure the exact number of Pod replicas you declare are always running.

Here’s what actually happens under the hood:

• The ReplicaSet watches the API server for the desired number of replicas.
• It checks how many Pods currently match its label selector.
• If the count is lower → it creates new Pods.
• If the count is higher → it deletes extra Pods.
• It keeps repeating this loop continuously, maintaining the exact replica count.

Important detail:

• ReplicaSets don’t handle updates.
• Deployments use new ReplicaSets for rollout and old ones for rollback.

Why ReplicaSets matter:

• They ensure availability of your workloads.
• They make sure pods recover after node failures.
• They form the foundation for Deployments and autoscaling.

In simple words:
ReplicaSets guarantee that the number of Pods you want is always the number of Pods you have.
