Kubernetes QoS Classes - Why They Matter?
Not all Pods are treated equally.

Kubernetes assigns a Quality of Service (QoS) class to every Pod based on its CPU and memory requests/limits.

There are 3 classes:
🟢 Guaranteed
➜ Requests = Limits for CPU & Memory (for every container)
➜ Most protected during node resource pressure
➜ Least likely to be evicted

🟡 Burstable
➜ Requests < Limits (or mixed requests/limits)
➜ Can use more when available, but has less eviction protection than Guaranteed

🔴 BestEffort
➜ No CPU/memory requests or limits
➜ Lowest eviction protection
➜ Often first to be evicted under node pressure

💡 Why this matters: During node pressure (commonly memory pressure), QoS helps you estimate which Pods are most likely to be evicted - BestEffort first, then Burstable, then Guaranteed.

No requests/limits = no resource guarantees.

If your workload is critical, set realistic requests and (where appropriate) limits. That’s how you improve stability in production.
