Today’s topic is a cornerstone of Kubernetes security: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). Whether you're running a dev cluster or managing a large production environment, RBAC is essential for controlling who can do what in your cluster.

🚪 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗥𝗕𝗔𝗖 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
RBAC is all about granting least-privilege access. It helps ensure users, service accounts, and applications only get the permissions they need—nothing more.
Without proper RBAC, one misconfigured account could accidentally (or maliciously) delete critical workloads or access sensitive data.

🧱 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝘀
There are four key components in Kubernetes RBAC:
 1. Role
   Defines a set of permissions (verbs like get, list, delete) for resources (like pods, deployments) within a specific namespace.
 2. ClusterRole
   Similar to Role, but applies cluster-wide or to non-namespaced resources like nodes or persistent volumes.
 3 .RoleBinding
   Connects a Role to a user, group, or service account within a namespace.
 4. ClusterRoleBinding
   Connects a ClusterRole to a user, group, or service account across the entire cluster.

🎯 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁
 • Use Role and RoleBinding when scoping permissions to a single namespace—ideal for multi-tenant environments.
 • Use ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding for cluster-wide permissions or resources that aren't namespace-scoped.
 • Avoid broad or wildcard permissions unless absolutely necessary.

🧠 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲
Imagine a development team that needs to view resources but not modify them. You can create a Role with read-only permissions and bind it to their user account in their namespace.

Now, if someone tries to delete a pod or create a service, they’ll be blocked—ensuring your cluster stays safe and stable.

🧰 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 & 𝗧𝗶𝗽𝘀
 • Use kubectl auth can-i to test what a user or service account can do.
 • Regularly audit RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings to prevent permission creep.
 • Use service accounts with minimal permissions for CI/CD pipelines and automation tools.
 • Consider third-party tools like rakkess, kubeaudit, or OPA Gatekeeper for deeper RBAC insights and policies.

✅ 𝗧𝗟;𝗗𝗥
RBAC helps secure your Kubernetes cluster by defining who can access what and how. It's a must-know for any K8s admin or developer working in a shared environment.

Understanding and implementing RBAC is your first step toward building a secure, scalable, and compliant Kubernetes setup.
