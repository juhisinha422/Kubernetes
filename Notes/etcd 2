etcd is the brain of your Kubernetes cluster.

While the API server handles communication, the etcd stores the cluster’s entire state - everything from Pod details to ConfigMaps and secrets.

What etcd does:
- Acts as Kubernetes’ key-value store
- Records every cluster configuration and change
- Ensures high availability and consistency across the control plane
- If etcd fails, your cluster forgets its state - that’s how critical it is.

Protect it with regular backups, encryption, and secure access.
