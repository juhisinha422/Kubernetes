Kubernetes Architecture


1. Kubectl : Lets you talk to Kubernetes
2. API Server: The brain that handles all requests
3. Controller Manager: Adjusts cluster resources as needed
4. Scheduler: Finds the best spot for workloads
5. Kubelet: Runs workloads on each machine
6. ETCD: Remembers everything about the cluster
7. Kube proxy: Directs traffic to the right workloads
8. POD: Where workloads actually run
9. Container Runtime: Runs the apps inside workloads
