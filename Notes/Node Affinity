Want to control where your pods run in your cluster? Node Affinity gives you the power to schedule pods based on node labels — making your deployments smarter and more predictable.

🔹 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗔𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆?
Node Affinity is a Kubernetes feature that allows you to constrain which nodes your pods are eligible to be scheduled on, based on node labels.

🧠 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗔𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆?
✅ Ensure pods run on nodes with specific hardware (e.g., GPU, SSD)
✅ Separate workloads by team, environment, or zone
✅ Improve performance by placing workloads close to required resources
✅ Achieve compliance, isolation, and cost efficiency

🛠️ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀:
🔸 Assign data-intensive apps to SSD nodes
🔸 Keep dev and prod workloads isolated
🔸 Place latency-sensitive services in a specific zone or region

⚙️ 𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀:
✔ Use clear and consistent node labels (𝘦𝘯𝘷=𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘥, 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘬𝘵𝘺𝘱𝘦=𝘴𝘴𝘥)
✔ Combine with taints/tolerations and resource limits for full control
✔ Avoid overly strict constraints to prevent unschedulable pods
✔ Monitor node availability when applying hard affinity rules
