Inside the Pod lifecycle, where Kubernetes workloads Begin and End.

Suppose you are debugging a data processing Job that mysteriously failed overnight.

No alerts. No logs. Just... vanished.

When I checked, I found the Pod in a terminal state: Failed.

That moment reminded me even the smallest Kubernetes Pod has a story.

Letâ€™s walk through it:

ðŸ”¸ 1. Pending: The Pod is born. The API server accepts it, but the scheduler hasnâ€™t placed it on a node yet.

 Common reasons?

 Insufficient resources, unschedulable taints, or a missing PVC.

ðŸ”¸ 2. Scheduled â†’ 

ContainerCreating: The scheduler picks a node. Kubelet pulls images, attaches volumes, and sets up networking.

 This is where ImagePullBackOff, ErrImagePull, or CreateContainerConfigError can surface.

ðŸ”¸ 3. Running: All containers are up and passing liveness and readiness probes.

 At this point, the Pod is actively serving traffic (if itâ€™s part of a Service) or doing its Job (pun intended).

ðŸ”¸ 4a. Succeeded: For Jobs or one-time tasks, all containers exit with code 0. The Pod lives on in logs, but itâ€™s complete.

ðŸ”¸ 4b. Failed: One or more containers crash (non-zero exit), and the Pod isnâ€™t restarting.

 Why? Could be OOMKilled, probe failures, or bad configs.

ðŸ”¸ 5. Unknown: This oneâ€™s tricky. The API server loses contact with the node, maybe due to a network partition or node crash.

Youâ€™ll need to dig into node health, kubelet logs, or even the cloud provider layer.

Why this matters:

If you manage workloads in Kubernetes, understanding the Pod lifecycle is non-negotiable.

The status isnâ€™t just a label, itâ€™s a window into orchestration, scheduling, and node health.

The next time a Pod fails silently, remember: every phase tells a story.
