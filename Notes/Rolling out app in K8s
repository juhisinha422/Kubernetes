Rolling Out Applications in Kubernetesâ€”

One of the most powerful ways to update an application in Kubernetes is through a rolling update.

 It ensures zero downtime by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Suppose I have a deployment named myapp with a container called mycontainer. I want to roll out a new image version.

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Update Image

kubectl set image deployment/myapp mycontainer=application:2.0
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Check Rollout Status

kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Rollback (if needed)

kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp

ðŸ”¹ Visual Flow (Rolling Update in Action)

[Old Pods: v1] ---> gradually replaced ---> [New Pods: v2]

Before:
[Pod v1] [Pod v1] [Pod v1]

During rollout:
[Pod v1] [Pod v1] [Pod v2]

After rollout:
[Pod v2] [Pod v2] [Pod v2]

âš¡With rolling updates, applications stay available, reliable, and production-readyâ€”no downtime!

 This is one of the must-know strategies for anyone working with Kubernetes in production.
