Kubernetes Services â€“ Making Pods Reachable

- In Kubernetes, Services help with:
1. DNS and Pod-to-Pod communication
2. Making your application available to external users

Key Points:
- A Service is created and attached to Pods based on labels and selectors.
-When we access a Service, traffic is routed to the actual Pods.
- #ClusterIP: Default type, generated automatically, cannot be accessed from outside.Used for pod to pod communication
- #NodePort: Superset of ClusterIP. A port from the range 30000-32767 is opened on all nodes. Using IP:NodePort, the app can be accessed externally. The port is also added to the security group automatically when the YAML is applied.
- #LoadBalancer: Superset of NodePort. A DNS name is created, allowing access without IP and port.
- Traffic routing usually follows round-robin technique.

ðŸ’¡ Takeaway:
- Services abstract Pods and make communication reliable, scalable, and easy both internally and externally.
