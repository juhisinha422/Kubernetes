How Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) protect your applications

Kubernetes can restart, move, or evict Pods — but not all at once.
That’s where Pod Disruption Budgets come in.

What a PDB does:

1. It defines how many Pods must stay available during voluntary disruptions.
2. It applies during:
 a. node drain
 b. cluster autoscaling
 c. rolling updates
3. It prevents too many Pods from going down at the same time.

How it works:

1. You define a minimum number or percentage of Pods that must be running.
2. Kubernetes checks the PDB before evicting any Pod.
3. If eviction would break availability, Kubernetes blocks it.

Why PDBs matter:

1. Protect critical services during maintenance.
2. Prevent cascading failures.
3. Improve application reliability.
4. Work seamlessly with rolling updates and autoscaling.

In simple words:
Pod Disruption Budgets tell Kubernetes,
“Don’t break my app while trying to fix the cluster.”
