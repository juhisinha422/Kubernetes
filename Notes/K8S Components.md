Kubernetes Components Simplified âš¡

ðŸ”¹ 1. Container â€“ Runs your app + dependencies in an isolated environment. (Ex: Docker nginx)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Pod â€“ Smallest deployable unit in K8s, can have multiple containers sharing network/storage. (Ex: nginx + sidecar)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Node â€“ Physical/VM machine hosting Pods. Includes Kubelet, Kube-proxy, and a    container runtime. (Ex: AWS EC2)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Service â€“ Provides a stable way to access Pods even if IPs change. (Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Cluster â€“ A group of Nodes (workers + control plane) running workloads & services. (Ex: 3 master + 10 worker nodes)

ðŸ”¹ 6. Control Plane â€“ The brain of Kubernetes managing the clusterâ€™s state. Components:

Â·       API Server

Â·       Scheduler

Â·       Controller Manager.

Â·       etcd

ðŸ”¹ 7. Package â€“ Bundled Kubernetes resources for deployment. (Ex: Helm Chart, Kustomize)
