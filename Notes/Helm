What is helm and how it works?

Helm is like a package manager for Kubernetes. Just as you use APT (for Ubuntu) or Yum (for CentOS) to install software on a computer, Helm helps you install and manage applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

How Does Helm Work?
Charts (Blueprints of Apps) – Helm uses Charts, which are like pre-configured templates for deploying applications. A Chart contains all the files and settings needed to install an application.

Installation & Deployment – Instead of writing long and complex Kubernetes configuration files (YAML), Helm lets you install apps with a simple command like

Helm install my-app chart-name

Customization – If you need to customize an app (e.g., change database settings), you can override default values easily using a values.yaml file.

Upgrades & Rollbacks – Helm tracks all changes, so you can upgrade your application or rollback to a previous version if needed.

Repositories (App Store for Kubernetes) – Helm Charts are stored in repositories (like Docker Hub for images), making it easy to share and reuse configurations.

Why Use Helm?
Simplifies Deployment – No need to manually write complex YAML files.
Easy Updates – Upgrade or revert applications without much hassle.
Reusability – Helm Charts can be used across multiple environment.
