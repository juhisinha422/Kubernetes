Back to Basics :Understanding Ephemeral Storage in Kubernetes

When working with containers and Pods, it's important to know where your data lives and what happens to it when things restart or get deleted.

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the two types of ephemeral storage in 
Kubernetes:

tmpfs in Container

Temporary storage inside a container
Data is lost when the container restarts or is deleted
Cannot be shared with other containers even in the same Pod

Ephemeral Volume in Pod

Shared volume at the Pod level
Data survives container restarts
Lost only if the entire Pod is deleted
Can be shared across multiple containers in the same Pod

In Short :

 Use tmpfs for single-container temp data. Use ephemeral volumes when multiple containers in a Pod need to share temporary data.

Understanding how ephemeral storage behaves helps you build more reliable and predictable containerized applications.
