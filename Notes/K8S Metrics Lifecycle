Did you know Kubernetes metrics have a lifecycle just like APIs?


1. Alpha – New metric. Cool, but it might change or disappear anytime.
2. Stable – Safe to use. Won’t change without notice.
3. Deprecated – Still exposed, but not for long. Start migrating.
4. Hidden – Not visible unless you explicitly re-enable it (with a version flag).
5. Deleted – Completely removed. Not coming back.

Why does this matter?
Because sometimes, after a Kubernetes upgrade, you’ll find that your alerts or dashboards suddenly break — and it’s not always obvious why. Turns out, the metric you were relying on might’ve just… quietly moved on in the lifecycle.
If you're using something like Prometheus or relying on custom dashboards, this can cause real headaches.

TIP -
If something breaks after a K8s upgrade, try --show-hidden-metrics-for-version ( --show-hidden-metrics-for-version=<k8s version> ). It might save your dashboards (and your weekend).

Monitoring isn’t just about collecting metrics — it’s about knowing which ones still exist.
