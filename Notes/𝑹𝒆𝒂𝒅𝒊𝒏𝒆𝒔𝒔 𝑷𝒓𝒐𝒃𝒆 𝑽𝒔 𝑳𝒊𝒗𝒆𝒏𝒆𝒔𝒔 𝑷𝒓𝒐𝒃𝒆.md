❇️ Readiness Probe

Purpose:

  ➡️ Checks if the container is ready to receive traffic.

If readiness fails:

  ▪️ Pod stays running, but

  ▪️ removed from Service endpoints

→ no traffic sent

  ▪️ Used to avoid sending traffic before app is ready (ex: DB connection not     ready).

❇️  Liveness Probe

Purpose:

  ➡️ Checks if the container is alive.

If liveness fails:

 ▪️ Kubelet kills & restarts the container.

▪️ Used to fix deadlocks or hung applications
