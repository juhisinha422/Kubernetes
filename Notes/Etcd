What is ETCD in K8's ❓ 

A database system Kubernetes uses to store networking🗄 information, cluster state and other persistent data.
It stores information as key-value🔐 pairs and does not overwrite pairs when an update is required. Instead, it creates a new database entry 🗒 and appends at the end 🔚, making previous entry for future removal.

Kubernetes interacts with the ETCD through its API server.

ETCD must be backed up in case the cluster fails 😵or faces a security incident.
Backing up ETCD data using 👇 :
🔸Snapshot using etcdctl.
🔸Replacing failed etcd member.
🔸Restoring etcd cluster.

Some important terms ✍ :

🔸--data-dir ➡ Directory in which ETCD restore all its config data by default.

🔸--listen-client-urls ➡ URL on which ETCD client is listening.

🔸--key-file ➡ Private key certificate.

🔸--cert-file ➡ Public key certificate.

🔸--trusted-ca-file ➡ Certified Authority certificate.
