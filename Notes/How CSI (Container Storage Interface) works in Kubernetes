How CSI (Container Storage Interface) works in Kubernetes

Kubernetes does not talk directly to storage systems.
It uses CSI as a standard interface.

CSI makes storage pluggable and vendor-independent.

What CSI is:

1. A standard API for storage providers.
2. Allows Kubernetes to work with any storage backend.
3. Replaces old in-tree volume plugins.
4. Used by cloud and on-prem storage systems.

CSI architecture:

1. CSI Controller
 a. Runs in the control plane.
 b. Handles volume creation, deletion, and attachment.
2. CSI Node Plugin
 a. Runs on every worker node.
 b. Mounts and unmounts volumes into Pods.
3. CSI Driver
 a. Implemented by storage vendors.
 b. Talks to the actual storage system.

How a volume is created:

1. A Pod requests storage using a PVC.
2. Kubernetes calls the CSI controller.
3. CSI driver creates the volume in the storage backend.
4. Volume is attached to the target node.
5. CSI node plugin mounts it into the Pod.

Why CSI matters:

1. No Kubernetes core changes needed for new storage.
2. Easier upgrades and maintenance.
3. Supports advanced features:
 a. snapshots
 b. volume expansion
 c. cloning
4. Works consistently across cloud providers.

In simple words:
CSI is the bridge between Kubernetes and storage systems.
