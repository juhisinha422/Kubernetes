Kubernetes Service Mesh. 
ðŸ”¹ What is a Service Mesh?
A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that manages service-to-service communication inside a Kubernetes (or microservices) environment.
Instead of putting networking, security, and observability logic inside your application code, a service mesh handles it transparently.
It usually works by deploying a sidecar proxy (like Envoy) alongside each pod to intercept traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Need a Service Mesh?
In Kubernetes, Services already provide:
Service discovery (DNS, ClusterIP)
Load balancing
Basic traffic routing
But modern microservices need more advanced features, like:
Security â†’ mTLS (mutual TLS) between services
Traffic control â†’ Canary, blue/green, A/B testing
Reliability â†’ Retries, failovers, rate limiting, circuit breaking
Observability â†’ Metrics, tracing, logging per request
ðŸ‘‰ Kubernetes alone doesnâ€™t provide all of these. Service Mesh fills the gap.

ðŸ”¹ How a Service Mesh Works
Data Plane
Made up of sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy).
Handles all service-to-service communication.
Enforces policies (like retries, rate limits, mTLS).
Control Plane
Configures and manages the data plane.
Provides APIs to define traffic rules, security policies, telemetry.
Examples: Istioâ€™s istiod, Linkerdâ€™s controller.

ðŸ”¹ Popular Service Mesh Tools in Kubernetes
Istio
Most feature-rich.
Uses Envoy sidecar proxies.
Strong support for security, observability, traffic shaping.
Linkerd
Lightweight, simpler than Istio.
Uses Rust-based sidecar proxies.
Focus on performance and simplicity.
Consul Connect (by HashiCorp)
Works across Kubernetes and VMs.
Strong service discovery + service mesh.
Cilium Service Mesh
Based on eBPF (no sidecars).
Lightweight, kernel-level performance.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of a Service Mesh
Traffic Management
Routing, load balancing, canary, blue/green deployments
Security
Mutual TLS, authorization, service identity
Reliability
Retries, timeouts, rate limiting, circuit breaking
Observability
Metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)
Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
Logs

ðŸ”¹ Benefits
Developers donâ€™t need to code networking/security features.
Consistent policies across all services.
Better resilience and reliability.
Enhanced visibility into microservice communication.

ðŸ”¹ When to Use a Service Mesh?
âœ… Good for:
Large microservices architectures
Need strong security (mTLS, zero trust)
Want advanced traffic control (canary, A/B testing)
Require deep observability into service-to-service traffic

ðŸ”¹ Example Flow (Istio with Envoy)
Pod A wants to talk to Pod B.
Pod Aâ€™s request goes to Envoy sidecar proxy.
Envoy applies policies (TLS, routing rules).
Envoy forwards request to Pod Bâ€™s Envoy proxy.
Pod Bâ€™s proxy delivers traffic to Pod B.
