𝗔𝗱𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀

Imagine you’re entering a company called 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝗰.
You walk in with your ID card that’s your 𝙠𝙪𝙗𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙡 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙡𝙮 -𝙛 𝙥𝙤𝙙.𝙮𝙖𝙢𝙡.

First, the 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱 checks who you are (Authentication).
Then, the 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗸 checks what you’re allowed to do (Authorization).

Now comes the front desk this is where 𝗔𝗱𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀 step in.
They don’t care who you are. They care about 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻.

They look into your “bag” (your YAML file) and say things like:
- “You can’t bring this inside.”
- “You missed your ID tag, I’ll add it.”
- “That item isn’t allowed here.”
Only after that check does your request enter the building (the cluster).

In short, 𝗔𝗱𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀 are 𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀 inside Kubernetes.
They can validate requests or modify them before saving.

Think of them like a party host checking guests at the door:
You decide who gets in, who gets labeled, and who’s turned away.

That’s exactly what Admission Controllers do they keep your Kubernetes cluster organized, secure, and mistake free.
