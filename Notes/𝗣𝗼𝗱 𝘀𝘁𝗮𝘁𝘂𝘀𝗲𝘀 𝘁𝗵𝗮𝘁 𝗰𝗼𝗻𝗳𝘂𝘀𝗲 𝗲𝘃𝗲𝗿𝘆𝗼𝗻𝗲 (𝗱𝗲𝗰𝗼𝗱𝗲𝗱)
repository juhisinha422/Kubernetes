Pod status messages look scary, but most of them are just signals.

𝟬/𝟮 𝗜𝗻𝗶𝘁
→ Init containers haven’t finished. The app hasn’t even started yet.

𝗣𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴
→ Kubernetes wants to run the pod, but can’t find resources or a node.

𝟭/𝟮 𝗥𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴
→ The pod has two containers. One is running, the other isn’t.
The pod exists, but it’s not fully functional — often because one container failed or isn’t ready yet.

𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗣𝘂𝗹𝗹𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗢𝗳𝗳
→ Kubernetes tried to pull the image and failed repeatedly.
Wrong image name, wrong tag, or missing registry auth.

𝗖𝗿𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗢𝗳𝗳
→ Container starts, fails, restarts… repeatedly. App-level failure.

𝗢𝗢𝗠𝗞𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱
→ Container exceeded memory limits and was killed by the kernel.
Very common, very misunderstood.

𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿
→ Container failed and didn’t recover.

𝗘𝘃𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱
→ Pod was removed due to node resource pressure
(memory, disk, inode exhaustion).

𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
→ Pod is being shut down but hasn’t exited yet.
Usually means slow shutdown, stuck finalizers, or blocked volumes.

𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗱
→ Job finished successfully. Nothing to fix here.

Most “Kubernetes issues” are actually telling you where to look - not what to panic about.
