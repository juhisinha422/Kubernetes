How Kubernetes handles Pod-to-Pod networking across nodes

One of Kubernetes’ biggest strengths is that Pods can talk to each other
even when they run on different nodes — without NAT.

Here’s how this works:

1. Every Pod gets a unique IP address.
2. That IP is routable across the entire cluster.
3. The CNI plugin sets up routing rules between nodes.
4. Each node knows how to reach Pods on other nodes.
5. Packets move directly from Pod → Pod, even across nodes.

What makes this possible:

1. CNI plugins (Calico, Cilium, Flannel, etc.).
2. Overlay or native routing networks.
3. No port mapping or NAT between Pods.
4. Flat cluster-wide network model.

Traffic flow example:

1. Pod A (Node 1) sends traffic to Pod B (Node 2).
2. Packet exits Node 1 via CNI routing.
3. Packet enters Node 2.
4. Pod B receives traffic directly on its IP.

Why this matters:

1. Simplifies microservice communication.
2. Makes service meshes and policies possible.
3. Avoids complex networking hacks.
4. Matches the “one IP per workload” model.

In simple words:
Kubernetes makes the entire cluster behave like one flat network,
no matter how many nodes you have.
