Resource Quotas & RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
ðŸ”¹ Resource Quotas
 Set boundaries on resource usage (CPU, memory, storage) within a namespace to ensure fair consumption and avoid over-provisioning.
 ðŸ”¸ Helps maintain cluster stability and prevent noisy neighbor issues.

ðŸ”¹ RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
 RBAC enables fine-grained permissions by assigning roles to users, groups, or service accounts.
 ðŸ”¸ Key components: Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings
 ðŸ”¸ Enhances security by enforcing the principle of least privilege.
ðŸ’¡ Takeaway: Proper resource limits + access control = a well-governed and secure Kubernetes cluster.
