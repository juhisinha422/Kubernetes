𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲 “𝗔𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗲𝗱”?

After authentication succeeds, Kubernetes asks:

Is this user allowed to perform this action?

This step is called 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.

When you run:

𝗸𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝗱 𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝘅

The API server checks:

• Who is making the request?
• What resource is being accessed? (pods)
• What action is being performed? (delete)
• Which namespace?

Then the authorization module evaluates policies.

Most clusters use RBAC as the authorization mechanism.

Important:

Authorization does NOT modify your request.
It only returns:

Allow 
or
Deny 

If denied → request stops immediately.
If allowed → it moves to Admission Controllers.

So the control plane flow is:

Authentication → Authorization → Admission → etcd
