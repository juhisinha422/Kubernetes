How Kubernetes handles configuration using ConfigMaps and Secrets

Applications need configuration, but hardcoding it inside containers is a bad idea.
Kubernetes separates configuration from application code.

That’s where ConfigMaps and Secrets come in.

ConfigMaps:

1. Used to store non-sensitive configuration.
2. Examples:
 a. environment variables
 b. config files
 c. command-line arguments
3. Can be consumed by Pods as:
 a. environment variables
 b. mounted files

Secrets:

1. Used to store sensitive data.
2. Examples:
 a. passwords
 b. API keys
 c. tokens
3. Stored base64-encoded and handled more securely.
4. Also injected as env vars or mounted files.

How Kubernetes manages them:

1. ConfigMaps and Secrets are stored in etcd.
2. API server controls access via RBAC.
3. kubelet mounts them into Pods at runtime.
4. Updates can be reflected without rebuilding images.

Why this matters:

1. Cleaner container images.
2. Better security practices.
3. Easier environment-specific configuration.
4. No redeploy needed for config-only changes.

In simple words:
ConfigMaps and Secrets let you change app behavior
without changing or rebuilding the application itself.
