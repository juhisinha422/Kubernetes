Node Selectors in Kubernetes 🚀
Node Selectors help control pod scheduling by matching pods to specific nodes based on labels — improving performance and resource utilization.

✅ How It Works:
- Label Your Nodes:
kubectl label node <node-name> disktype=ssd

-Add Node Selector to Pod:
spec:  
  nodeSelector:  
    disktype: ssd  

🔹 Use Cases:
✔️ Run GPU workloads on GPU nodes
 ✔️ Isolate workloads based on hardware specs
 ✔️ Schedule pods based on storage or network type

🔹 Limitations:
❌ Basic scheduling only — use Node Affinity for complex logic
