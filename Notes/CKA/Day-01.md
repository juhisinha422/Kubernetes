Kubernetes Learning from Scratch â€“ All the way to CKA

 â€“ Day 1: KubeAPI Server




The KubeAPI Server is the entry point of Kubernetes â€“ everything in the cluster goes through it.

ðŸ”‘ What it does:

âœ… Authenticates users (who is making the request)

âœ… Validates requests (are they correct?)

âœ… Talks directly to etcd, which stores all cluster data

âœ… Acts as a communication hub â€“ the Scheduler and Kubelet interact with it to perform updates

ðŸ“Œ Setup note:

If we create a cluster using kubeadm, the API Server runs as a pod inside the kube-system namespace on the control-plane node.

In short, the KubeAPI Server is like the brainâ€™s nervous system â€“ connecting every action and making sure the cluster state is always updated.
