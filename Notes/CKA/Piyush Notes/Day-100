Day-100 – Static Website Hosting on AWS (Production-Grade Setup)
Completed a secure and production-ready static website hosting solution on AWS, implemented entirely using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code).
This exercise wasn’t about simply putting a website online.

What was implemented:
Private Amazon S3 bucket with all public access blocked
Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery, caching, and compression
Origin Access Control (OAC) to securely connect CloudFront to S3
ACM certificate (us-east-1) to enable HTTPS
Amazon Route53 for custom domain configuration (space9.in)
Static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) deployed using Terraform

Why this approach matters:
S3 is never directly exposed to the internet
HTTPS is enforced end-to-end
Least-privilege access is consistently applied
The architecture scales without redesign
Infrastructure is fully reproducible using IaC
This setup reflects how static frontends are hosted in real-world AWS production environments, not demo or shortcut-based implementations.

Tech stack:
 AWS · S3 · CloudFront · ACM · Route53 · Terraform
Day 100 completed.
 On to the next challenge.
