Day-77
Modern CI/CD is no longer about getting the workflow to pass.
 It is about engineering delivery systems that scale with teams and products.

In GitHub Actions, the core patterns remain consistent:
1) Lint early to fail fast
2) Test deterministically with proper dependency caching
3) Build reproducible, traceable artifacts
4) Deploy using short-lived credentials (OIDC over static secrets)
5) Prefer GitOps when auditability and rollback matter

What separates basic pipelines from production-grade CI/CD is intentional design:
 incremental execution, clear ownership boundaries, security by default, and observability built into the workflow itself.
This is the mindset I focus on while designing and reviewing pipelines optimizing for reliability, clarity, and long-term operability, not just green checks.
If you are building or evolving CI/CD at scale, these fundamentals matter more than tools.
