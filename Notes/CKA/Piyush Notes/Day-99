Day-99 | Terraform Data Sources
If you’re hardcoding AMI IDs, VPC IDs, or subnet IDs, you’re not doing Infrastructure as Code  you’re doing scripted guesswork.

Terraform data sources are how real environments work:
Read existing infrastructure
Reuse shared VPCs and subnets
Fetch the latest AMIs automatically
Consume remote state instead of copy-pasting values
Data sources don’t create.
 They connect your stacks safely and cleanly.
This is the difference between demo Terraform and production Terraform.
