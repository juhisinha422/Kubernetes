#Day-88 | Terraform Remote State (Why It’s Non-Negotiable)
Terraform doesn’t manage infrastructure by scanning the cloud.
 It trusts the state file.

Keeping state locally breaks the moment you work in a team:
No locking
No collaboration
High risk of corruption
A remote backend (S3 + native state locking):
Creates a single source of truth
Prevents concurrent terraform apply
Secures sensitive data with encryption
Enables recovery via versioning

From Terraform 1.10+, S3 native state locking replaces DynamoDB — simpler, cheaper, and the recommended path.
Terraform state is production infrastructure. Treat it that way.
