#Day 52 
Today I explored how Kubernetes handles persistent storage using Storage Classes, and the difference between Static and Dynamic provisioning something every DevOps or Cloud engineer must understand.

A) Static Provisioning:
In static provisioning, storage admins manually create PVs ahead of time.
 A PVC is then matched to an existing PV if size, access mode, and storage class align.
 This works, but it’s manual and can lead to unused or over-allocated storage.

B) Dynamic Provisioning: 
Dynamic provisioning is cloud-native and automatic.
 When a developer creates a PVC and references a StorageClass, Kubernetes uses the SC’s provisioner (e.g., GCE PD, AWS EBS, Azure Disk, NFS CSI) to create a new PV on demand.
 It reduces cost, prevents manual work, and gives flexibility (SSD/HDD/NFS, performance tiers, etc.).

 StorageClass Overview
A StorageClass defines:
The provisioner (cloud disk, NFS, CSI driver)
Parameters like disk type, performance, filesystem
Reclaim policy (Retain/Delete)
Binding mode
This makes it easy to choose the right storage for each workload.
