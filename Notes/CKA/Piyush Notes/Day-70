#Day 70 
Blue-Green Deployment Strategy with Argo Rollouts on Kubernetes

Today’s focus was on implementing a production-grade Blue-Green deployment using Argo Rollouts, NGINX Ingress, and Kubernetes — without downtime and with full traffic control.

🔹 What I worked on
Implemented Blue-Green deployments using Argo Rollouts
Used Active and Preview Services to control traffic flow
Managed version changes using a single Docker image and environment variables
Integrated NGINX Ingress (NodePort) for external access
Performed manual promotion to safely switch live traffic
🔹 Key Learnings
Argo Rollouts extends Kubernetes Deployments with advanced strategies
Any change in spec.template triggers a new ReplicaSet
Blue-Green traffic switching is handled by service selector manipulation using pod-template-hash
Preview environments allow validation before production promotion
Zero downtime is achievable with the right rollout strategy
🔹 Why this matters
 Blue-Green deployments are widely used in real-world systems to:
 ✅ Reduce deployment risk
 ✅ Enable instant rollbacks
 ✅ Improve release confidence
 ✅ Maintain application availability
