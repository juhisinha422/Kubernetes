#Day-91 | Terraform Variables Engineering for Scale, Not Demos
Hard-coding works for tutorials.
It fails immediately in real environments.

At scale, Terraform must be:
Parameter-driven, not copy-pasted
Environment-agnostic, not dev-only
Consistent by design, not by discipline

Best practices applied:
Input variables for external control
Locals for derived values and naming standards
Outputs for controlled visibility
Zero hard-coded environments
One codebase → multiple environments
If you’re editing Terraform files to switch from dev to prod,
 you’re not managing infrastructure you’re babysitting it.
Write Terraform like software.
 Design once. Scale safely.
