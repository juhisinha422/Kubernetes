Day-26
Today’s deep dive was all about understanding Network Policies in Kubernetes 

I explored why network flow control matters and how to secure communication between pods in a production-grade cluster.

Kubernetes allows all pods to talk to each other by default — but in real-world systems, that’s not always safe 

Key Learnings:

Network Policies define which pods can communicate — and on which ports.
They work with CNIs (like Calico, Cilium, Weave Net) that enforce these rules.
We created policies to ensure only the backend can talk to the database, blocking direct access from the frontend.
 Implemented this using Calico as a CNI provider for advanced policy support.

Best Practice:
Start with a default deny-all policy, then explicitly allow only the traffic you need — this ensures least privilege and production-grade network isolation.
