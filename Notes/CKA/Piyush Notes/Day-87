#Day-87 | DevOps Reality Check
Running Terraform locally is fine for learning and quick testing.
That’s how most of us start.
But in production, that model fails.
❌ Not scalable
❌ Not auditable
❌ Not real DevOps

Production DevOps follows GitOps:
Git is the single source of truth
Changes go through PRs
Pipelines apply infra not laptops
Access is short-lived and traceable
If your local machine can change prod infra, you already have a problem.
What I did today

Before automating Terraform, I set up the foundation:
GitHub Actions → AWS OIDC
No hardcoded access keys.
No stored secrets.
GitHub assumes an IAM role dynamically  least privilege, auditable, secure.
Takeaway
Local Terraform = learning
GitOps + CI/CD = production
DevOps isn’t about running commands.
It’s about building safe, scalable systems.
