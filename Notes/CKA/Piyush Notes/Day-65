#Day 65:
Advancing My DevOps Journey – Integrating GitHub SSO with ArgoCD + SSL Hardening

Today’s milestone was all about strengthening security, access management, and operational efficiency by implementing GitHub Single Sign-On (SSO) with ArgoCD, backed by NGINX reverse proxy and Certbot SSL.

Modern DevOps environments demand secure, centralized identity managementespecially when working with GitOps platforms like ArgoCD. By integrating GitHub OAuth, I established a streamlined authentication pipeline that removes credential friction while enforcing strong security controls across the CI/CD lifecycle.
Key Highlights:
 • Configured DNS & deployed NGINX as a secure reverse proxy
 • Automated SSL/TLS certificate issuance with Certbot
 • Registered and configured a GitHub OAuth App for ArgoCD SSO
 • Deployed ArgoCD on Kubernetes and enabled external access
 • Integrated GitHub SSO to deliver a unified, secure login experience
 • Validated end-to-end flow with OAuth, SSL, and ArgoCD dashboard access

This workflow significantly improves security posture, reduces manual overhead, and enhances developer experiencean essential step toward a fully mature GitOps model.
Why this matters:
 Centralized authentication isn’t just a convenience it is a foundational component of scalable DevOps ecosystems.
