Day-86 | Terraform AWS Provider  what most people misunderstand
Terraform doesn’t talk to AWS.
 The AWS Provider does.
That distinction matters more than most teams realize.

The provider is the execution layer that:
Translates HCL into AWS API calls
Enforces compatibility between Terraform core and AWS services
Decides whether your infra is reproducible or fragile
If you don’t pin provider versions, you’re not doing Infrastructure as Code —
 you’re doing Infrastructure by Chance.

What serious teams do instead:
Lock Terraform core and provider versions
Use pessimistic constraints (~>)
Test upgrades before production
Treat providers as production dependencies, not boilerplate
Most outages caused by “Terraform bugs” are actually provider version mistakes.
