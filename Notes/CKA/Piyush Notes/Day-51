#Day 51 
Today I learned how Admission Controllers work in Kubernetes — and honestly, this is one of the coolest internal mechanisms so far.

What they do:
Admission Controllers check every API request after authentication & authorization, and before it goes into etcd.
Think of them like:
Security + Policy Gatekeepers for your cluster.
 Types
1) Mutating Webhooks → can MODIFY your request
2) Validating Webhooks → can ACCEPT or REJECT your request
3) Validating Policies (VAP) → built-in rules using CEL

What I tested today
Tried creating a pod in a namespace that didn’t exist → ❌ error.
 Enabled NamespaceAutoProvision → Kubernetes automatically created the namespace → ✅ success.
 
Why it matters 🤔 :
Admission Controllers help enforce:
 ✔ Security
 ✔ Best practices
 ✔ Cluster-wide rules
 ✔ Automation
