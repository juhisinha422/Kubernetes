#Day-54
Today I deep-dived into one of the MOST important areas of Kubernetes security — Pod Security, Security Context & Linux Capabilities.

1. Security Context (Pod & Container Level):
Security Context controls the identity, privileges, and permissions of your container process.
Key fields I explored today:
runAsUser → Set the process UID (avoid UID 0/root!)
runAsGroup → Group ID for process
runAsNonRoot → Ensures containers NEVER run as root
fsGroup → Controls file permissions on mounted volumes
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false → Prevents privilege elevation (must-know!)

2. Linux Capabilities:
Capabilities define what a container can or cannot do at kernel level.
Dangerous capabilities to avoid unless absolutely necessary:
CAP_NET_ADMIN – Modify network interfaces, routing tables
CAP_SYS_ADMIN – Mount filesystems, change kernel params (very high risk)
CAP_SYS_TIME – Modify system clock

3. Pod Security Standards (PSS):
Kubernetes defines 3 built-in security profiles:
🔴 Privileged – No restrictions
🟠 Baseline – Basic protections
🟢 Restricted – Strongest isolation (used in production & CKS exam)

Restricted Pods enforce:
No root user
No privilege escalation
Drop all capabilities
Seccomp RuntimeDefault
No hostPath, hostNetwork, hostPID

Mastering Pod Security means you can confidently secure workloads, protect clusters from privilege misuse, and implement zero-trust principles in Kubernetes.
