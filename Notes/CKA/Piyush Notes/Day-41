Day-41
Today I shifted gears from learning concepts to mastering the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam strategy — focusing on speed, efficiency, and the "imperative first" mindset.

Key Learnings (Exam Strategy & Efficiency Insights):
1️⃣ Imperative > Declarative (for speed). Don't write YAML from scratch. Use kubectl run with dry-run flags to generate skeletons instantly. export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml" saves minutes per question.
2️⃣ The "Copy-Paste" Trap. The exam terminal is a Linux emulator. Standard shortcuts won't work. Ctrl+C = Kills the process ⚠️ Ctrl+Shift+C/V = Copy/Paste ✅ Building this muscle memory is crucial to avoid frustration.
3️⃣ Master kubectl explain. Stop browsing documentation for every field definition. kubectl explain pv.spec.capacity gives you the answer faster than Chrome can load the page.
4️⃣ Context is King. Every question switches clusters. If you miss the kubectl config use-context command, you fail the question—even if your solution is perfect. Read question → Set Context → Solve.
5️⃣ Triage Your Questions. Not all tasks are created equal. • Tier 1: Pods/Scaling (Do immediately). 
• Tier 2: Upgrades/ETCD Backup (Do mid-exam). 
• Tier 3: Complex Network Policies/JSONPath (Bookmark for last).
6️⃣ Vim Essentials. You don't need to be a Vim wizard, but you must know: dd (delete line), u (undo), Shift+G (jump to end), and o (insert new line below). Speed editing is a survival skill.
