#Day -74
Most CI/CD failures don’t come from tools.
They come from misunderstanding scope, triggers, and data flow.

Today’s focus:
How workflows are actually triggered (manual, push, PR, cron)
Environment variable scope (workflow ≠ job ≠ step)
Passing data correctly between jobs (not abusing env vars)
Secrets vs variables vs environments  and why it matters in production
GitHub Actions looks simple until you scale it.

 Then these details stop being “nice to know” and start being operational risk.
Building this as part of an open-source DevOps learning series practical, opinionated, and production-focused.
If you work with CI/CD at scale, you already know why this matters.
