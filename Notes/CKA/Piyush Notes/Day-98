Day 98 – Terraform Functions (Used the Way Production Demands)
Terraform functions are not “"nice to have".
They exist because hardcoded infrastructure fails in real environments.

Today’s focus:
Normalizing resource names before cloud rejects them
Merging tags so Finance, Security, and Ops stop fighting
Environment-driven instance sizing (dev ≠ prod)
Validating inputs so bad configs never reach apply
Turning raw cost data into usable insights
This is what separates Terraform users from infrastructure engineers.

If your Terraform doesn’t:
validate inputs
adapt by environment
protect naming, cost, and security
you’re just writing scripts, not infrastructure.
