#Day-61
Today I deep-dived into the Argo CD UI and GitOps workflow, understanding why each UI component exists and how it fits into real-world Kubernetes continuous delivery. GitOps is not just a toolset anymore — it’s the operating model for modern DevOps & Platform teams. 

🔄 Why Argo CD & GitOps Matter
 Argo CD enables declarative, version-controlled, and automated deployments where:
🧩 Key Argo CD UI Components I Worked On Today
📦 Applications – Defines what gets deployed and keeps it always in sync
 🗂️ Projects – Security and logical boundaries for microservices (frontend, backend, DB)
 🔗 Repositories – Secure GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket integration via HTTPS, SSH, GitHub App & GCP
 🌍 Clusters – Multi-cluster GitOps deployment (Dev, Staging, Production)
 🔐 Accounts & RBAC – Fine-grained access control
 🎨 Appearance – UI personalization for better DevOps experience
 👤 User Info – Admin password & profile management
 🔏 GnuPG & Certificates – Verified commits & secure repo trust
🖥️ Important CLI Learning
 To securely add new Kubernetes clusters to Argo CD, CLI authentication is required:
 argocd login → argocd cluster add
 This ensures controlled, audited, and secure multi-cluster access.
⚙️ Application Creation – Production-Grade Controls

 ✅ Sync Policies (Manual / Auto)
 ✅ Namespace Auto-Creation
 ✅ Pruning & Self-Healing
 ✅ Server-Side Apply
 ✅ Git Branch, Path & Revision Control
 ✅ Multi-Cluster & Multi-Namespace Targeting

💡 Big Takeaway
 Argo CD is not just a CD tool  it’s a control plane for Kubernetes deployments, enabling scalable GitOps across teams, clusters, and environments.
