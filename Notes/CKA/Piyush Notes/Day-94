#Day-94
Today I deep-dived into Terraform Meta-Arguments the real control plane of Terraform that decides how infrastructure is created, scaled, and destroyed.

Key Learnings (Production-Grade Terraform):
1️⃣ count is simple  and dangerous
 Great for identical, disposable resources.
 Terrible for long-lived infrastructure due to index shifting and unintended recreation.
2️⃣ for_each is the default choice in production
 Stable resource identity, predictable plans, clean diffs.
 If keys matter, for_each is non-negotiable.
3️⃣ depends_on is not a fix  it’s a last resort
 If you need it everywhere, your dependency design is broken.
 Terraform already builds a graph don’t fight it.
4️⃣ lifecycle meta-arguments protect critical resources
 prevent_destroy saves databases.
 create_before_destroy prevents downtime.
 ignore_changes must be used surgically, or Terraform stops being the source of truth.
5️⃣ for expressions belong in locals, not resources
 Transform data once.
 Keep resource blocks boring and readable.
6️⃣ Meta-arguments control blast radius
 Misuse them and Terraform becomes unpredictable.
 Use them correctly and infra changes become boring which is the goal.

Pro Tip:
 If your Terraform plan surprises you, that’s not “Terraform being complex”.
 That’s poor use of meta-arguments.
Infrastructure should change deliberately, not accidentally.
