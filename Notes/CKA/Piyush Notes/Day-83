Day-83
Most GitHub Actions workflows are designed to pass.
SREs design workflows to survive failure.

A "working" pipeline is not production-ready if:
One failed step collapses the entire workflow
Re-running jobs makes things worse
latest tags destroy rollback safety
CI failures give logs but no signal
Credentials are shared like config files
CI/CD is production infrastructure.
 If it isn’t fault-tolerant, observable, and recoverable
 your delivery pipeline is your next outage.
Today I documented how I’m redesigning my workflows the SRE way:
 failure isolation, fail-fast signals, immutable artifacts, and explicit recovery paths.

This is the difference between automation and reliability.
If you’re building GitHub Actions at scale, you already know this.
 If not, now you do.
