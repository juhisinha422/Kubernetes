#Day-57
Today I dived deep into the world of GitOps and explored some of the most popular tools that power modern Kubernetes delivery workflows.

Tools like Argo CD, FluxCD, Jenkins X, and Spinnaker enable a completely new way of managing cluster deployments . where Git becomes the single source of truth, and the GitOps controller continuously ensures the cluster always matches what we declare in the repository.

What really stood out today was Argo CD, a CNCF graduated project originally created at Applatix (later acquired by Intuit).
 Its ecosystem has grown massively Argo CD, Argo Workflows, Argo Events, Argo Rollouts all backed by contributors from Akuity, Intuit, BlackRock, Codefresh, Red Hat, and more.

I broke down Argo CD’s internal architecture :
 🔹 Repo Server (talks to Git and fetches manifests)
 🔹 Application Controller (continuously reconciles cluster state with Git)
 🔹 API Server / UI (where users interact via CLI or dashboard)
 🔹 Dex for Single Sign-On
 🔹 Redis for caching and state

The magic lies in its reconciliation loop:
 If someone manually changes a Kubernetes object, Argo CD immediately detects drift and restores the state based on Git. True self-healing, something traditional CI/CD pipelines cannot offer.
