Argo Rollouts: Progressive Delivery on Kubernetes 

Shipping to production should not feel like a gamble.
Kubernetes Deployments are great but they stop short when you need:
 • Controlled traffic shifting
 • Safe production validation
 • Automated rollbacks based on real metrics
That’s where Argo Rollouts comes in.

What Argo Rollouts enables:
 ✔️ Blue-Green deployments for last-minute production testing
 ✔️ Canary releases with gradual traffic percentages (10% → 30% → 100%)
 ✔️ Automated promotion or rollback using metrics
 ✔️ Seamless integration with Ingress & service meshes

Why it matters:
 Argo Rollouts helps teams release faster without sacrificing reliability a critical skill for modern DevOps and SRE roles.
