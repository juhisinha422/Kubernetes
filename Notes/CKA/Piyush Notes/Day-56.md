Day-56

Today I learned about GitOps and how tools like Argo CD are transforming the way we handle application delivery and infrastructure management.
In this learning session I:

 👉 Understood what GitOps is and why Git becomes the single source of truth

 👉 Explored why manual cluster changes lack tracking, auditing, and visibility

 👉 Learned how GitOps brings version control, approvals, and reviews to deployments

 👉 Studied GitOps principles: Declarative, Versioned & Immutable, Pulled Automatically, Continuously Reconciled

 👉 Understood how GitOps controllers detect drift and automatically correct it

 👉 Explored popular GitOps tools like Argo CD and Flux CD

 👉 Learned how GitOps applies not only to applications but also to infrastructure at scale

GitOps brings reliability, security, and predictability — especially crucial when managing multiple clusters and thousands of resources in real-world environments.
