Day-48
Today I worked on migrating from Ingress to the Kubernetes Gateway API, especially as #Ingress-NGINX maintenance officially ends in March 2026.
 This means many Platform, DevOps, and SRE teams are now evaluating what comes next — and the clear answer is Gateway API.

🚫 What’s happening with Ingress?
Ingress has been the default entrypoint for years, but:
❌ No new features
 ❌ No long-term maintenance
 ❌ Annotation-heavy & vendor-specific
 ❌ Limited to HTTP/HTTPS
 ❌ Harder to scale across teams
This makes it unsuitable for modern, large-scale, multi-team Kubernetes environments.

 What Gateway API Brings (The Future of K8s Networking):
Gateway API is the next-generation, standardized way to manage traffic inside Kubernetes. It supports:
✅ HTTP / HTTPS
 ✅ gRPC
 ✅ TCP / UDP
 ✅ Header-based & method-based routing
 ✅ Traffic splitting (canary, A/B, blue-green)
 ✅ Better security boundary
 ✅ Clear separation between Platform Teams & App Teams
 ✅ Standard YAML across all vendors (no annotation chaos 🎉)
🧩 Enterprise API Gateway Examples

These vendors already support Gateway API and are widely used in production:
#Kong Gateway
#Ambassador Edge Stack
#Gloo Gateway
#NGINX Gateway Fabric
#Istio Gateway (Service Mesh + Gateway)
These options make it easier for orgs to adopt Gateway API based on their needs performance, security, or mesh integration.
