Day 66  | Enterprise SSO for Argo CD with Okta 🔐

Most Argo CD setups fail in one critical area: identity and access management.
Local users. Shared admin credentials.
 No centralized control. No audit trail.
That does not scale.

Today I implemented enterprise-grade Single Sign-On (SSO) for Argo CD using Okta, running on Kubernetes.
What this setup delivers:
 • Centralized authentication via Okta
 • Secure SSO flow using SAML + Dex
 • Group-based RBAC inside Argo CD
 • HTTPS access via AWS ALB + ACM
 • No local users, no credential sprawl
Architecture highlights:
 Okta → Dex → Argo CD → Kubernetes 
 TLS terminated at the Load Balancer
 Authorization enforced via Argo CD RBAC
This is how you move from a demo-grade Argo CD setup to a production-ready platform.

SSO is not a “nice to have”.
It is mandatory once multiple teams touch your cluster.

Question for the community:
Are you using OIDC or SAML for Argo CD authentication in production — and why?
