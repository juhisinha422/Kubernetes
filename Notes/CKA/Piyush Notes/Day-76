Day-76  GitHub Actions → AWS Authentication (Best Practice)

Static AWS credentials are useful only for demos and explaining fundamentals.
In real CI/CD systems, they are technical debt.

In production, the correct approach is:
1) GitHub Actions issuing an OIDC token
2) AWS STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
3) Short-lived credentials generated at runtime
4) No secrets stored in GitHub

This is not about being fancy.
It’s about reducing blast radius, eliminating key rotation, and enforcing repo- and branch-level trust through IAM.

Static credentials help you learn.
OIDC is how you operate securely at scale.
I’ve documented a complete, reproducible demo static vs OIDC—along with IAM trust policies and verification using sts get-caller-identity.
