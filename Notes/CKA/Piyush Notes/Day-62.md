Multi-Cluster GitOps Deployment on AWS (EKS + ArgoCD)

Successfully built a Hub–Spoke multi-cluster architecture using Amazon EKS and ArgoCD, where a central Hub cluster manages application deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters in different regions using GitOps.

✅ 3 EKS clusters (Hub + 2 Spokes)

✅ Multi-region setup (ap-south-1 & us-east-1)

✅ ArgoCD for GitOps deployments

✅ Guestbook app deployed via GitHub repo

This hands-on project strengthened my understanding of multi-cluster Kubernetes, GitOps workflows, and real-world DevOps automation on AWS.
