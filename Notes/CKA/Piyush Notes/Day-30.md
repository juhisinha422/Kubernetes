Day-30

Today’s deep dive was all about DNS — the Domain Name System 

We explored how DNS translates human-readable names (like google.com) into machine-friendly IP addresses — the true backbone of the internet! 

1) Understood how DNS resolution works step-by-step

2) Learned about browser, OS, and ISP-level caching

3) Explored Root, TLD & Authoritative DNS servers

4) Ran nslookup to trace real-world domain lookups

5) Discussed redundancy — how 13 logical root servers handle billions of queries through global anycast networks

Key takeaway:

DNS is more than just name resolution it’s a globally distributed, fault-tolerant system that keeps the internet connected and reliable.

Pro Tip: Use public DNS like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8) for faster and more secure lookups.
