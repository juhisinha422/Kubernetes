Day-78 – GitHub Actions Marketplace: Use It Smart, Not Blind
The GitHub Actions Marketplace can accelerate CI/CD—or quietly introduce risk.

The difference is how you evaluate what you use.
Marketplace actions are not “just YAML shortcuts.”
They execute with your repository access, secrets, and permissions. Treat them like production dependencies.

What I focused on today:
How to evaluate third-party actions beyond stars and downloads
Why Verified badges help but are not enough
What “project health” actually means (commits, releases, maintainer activity)
When writing a custom step is safer than using an action
One non-negotiable best practice:
Always pin actions to commit SHAs, not tags.
Tags can be retargeted. Commits are immutable.
This single habit can protect your pipeline from supply-chain attacks.
Actions I trust and regularly see in production:
actions/checkout, actions/cache
actions/setup-node / go / java
Cloud auth via OIDC (aws-actions, azure/login, google-github-actions)
docker/build-push-action for multi-arch images

Key takeaway:
The Marketplace is a discovery layer, not a trust layer.
Professional DevOps engineers audit, pin, and own their dependencies.
Actively building and reviewing production-grade CI/CD workflows.
Open to discussions and opportunities in DevOps / Platform / Cloud Engineering.
