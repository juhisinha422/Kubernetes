#Day-97 | Terraform Functions
Terraform functions are not "nice to have".
They are what separate toy IaC from production-ready infrastructure.

Without functions:
Inputs stay unvalidated
Resource names break AWS constraints
Configurations become environment-specific
Errors surface during apply instead of plan

Terraform functions solve this by:
Normalizing user input
Enforcing constraints early
Handling dynamic values safely
Making modules reusable and predictable
If you are writing Terraform without regularly using functions like lookup, merge, regex, can, or formatdate, you are leaving correctness to chance.
Functions are guardrails.
 Remove them, and your infrastructure becomes fragile.
