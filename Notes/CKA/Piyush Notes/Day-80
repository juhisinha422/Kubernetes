#Day-80 | Debugging GitHub Actions the SRE Way
Most CI/CD failures are not "hard problems".
They’re the result of:
Poor observability
Hidden assumptions
Blind log scrolling

What many engineers call debugging is guesswork.
 What SRE teams do is systematic fault isolation.
Over time, I’ve learned that reliable pipelines are not defined by how often they pass  but by how quickly failures can be diagnosed without panic or SSH access.

Key principles I now follow when debugging GitHub Actions:
• Never debug blindly  identify what changed
 • Classify failures before fixing (deterministic vs flaky vs environment-specific)
 • Turn on debug logging temporarily, not permanently
 • Verify inputs explicitly  most bugs start there
 • Isolate the failing step instead of touching everything
 • Capture artifacts, not screenshots
 • Avoid SSH unless the pipeline design has already failed

If you need SSH access regularly, the problem isn’t GitHub Actions.
 It’s observability discipline.
CI/CD should explain itself.
 If it doesn’t, that’s an engineering gap  not a tooling issue.
I’m actively working deeper into GitHub Actions, CI observability, and SRE-style pipeline design and open to conversations around DevOps / Platform / SRE roles where reliability actually matters.
