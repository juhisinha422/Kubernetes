Day-58

Today I got hands-on with Argo CD and dove deeper into how GitOps actually comes to life inside a Kubernetes cluster.

In this session I:

 👉 Created a local multi-node Kubernetes cluster using Kind

👉 Installed Argo CD and explored every core component — API Server, Repo Server, Application Controller, ApplicationSet Controller, Dex, Redis

👉 Understood the purpose of each component and how they work together to enable Git-driven deployments

👉 Exposed the Argo CD UI, retrieved initial credentials, and deployed sample applications
 
👉 Explored how Argo CD supports Helm, Kustomize, and declarative YAML without being opinionated
 
👉 Practiced creating applications from both UI and CLI to understand real GitOps workflows
Every layer of Argo CD reinforces how powerful declarative, automated, drift-free deployments can be especially at scale.
