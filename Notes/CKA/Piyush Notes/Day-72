Canary Deployments with Argo Rollouts (setWeight) 

Canary deployments allow you to release new application versions gradually, reducing risk and protecting users from widespread failures.
In this example, I explored Argo Rollouts using the setWeight strategy, where traffic is shifted in steps (20% → 40% → 60% → 80% → 100%) with optional pause points for validation.

🔑 Key insights:
setWeight controls traffic exposure, not just pod count
With NodePort or ClusterIP, traffic is split indirectly by scaling Canary pods and relying on Kubernetes Service load balancing
For production-grade traffic control, a cloud LoadBalancer, Ingress, or service mesh (NGINX, ALB, Istio) is recommended for precise routing and observability

🌍 Real-world use case:
 Imagine deploying a new payment service version:
Start with 20% of users
Monitor errors, latency, and business metrics
Pause if needed
Gradually expand once confidence is built
This approach is especially valuable for mission-critical systems, where safety matters more than speed.

🧠 Canary isn’t about deploying faster — it’s about deploying smarter.
