Argo CD GitOps Deployment – Application vs App-of-Apps vs ApplicationSet

Here is the practical difference:
✅ Application
 Use when you need to deploy one service to one environment.
 Best for simple, standalone deployments.
✅ App-of-Apps
 Use when you want one parent application to manage multiple child applications.
 Commonly used for cluster bootstrapping and managing a group of services together.
✅ ApplicationSet
 Use when you need dynamic, scalable deployments.
 Best for multi-cluster, multi-environment, preview environments, and large microservice platforms.

Quick rule of thumb:
 Application → Single deployment
 App-of-Apps → Static group of deployments
 ApplicationSet → Dynamic factory for deployments
