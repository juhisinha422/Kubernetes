#Day-34

Today I dove into Kubernetes Cluster Upgrades — keeping multi-node clusters stable, secure, and zero-downtime ready! ⚙️🚀

Key Learnings:

1️⃣ Always drain & cordon nodes before maintenance — saves your workloads from chaos!
2️⃣ Never run critical apps as standalone pods (looking at you, MySQL 😅). Use Deployments or StatefulSets.
3️⃣ Kubernetes supports upgrades only 3 minor versions apart → step through 1.32 → 1.33 → 1.34.
4️⃣ Control plane first, workers next.
5️⃣ Choose Rolling upgrades for minimal impact or Blue-Green for managed clusters (EKS/AKS/GKE).

💡 Pro tip: After every upgrade — verify your cluster with kubectl get nodes and kubectl get pods -A.

Upgrading K8s isn’t just about new versions — it’s about resilience, reliability, and readiness!
