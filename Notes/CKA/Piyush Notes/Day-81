CI/CD doesn’t fail because of YAML.
It fails because of poor engineering decisions.

Most GitHub Actions pipelines slow down over time due to:
No performance baselines
No change detection
Over-permissioned workflows
Copy-pasted YAML with no ownership

Senior DevOps / SRE teams treat CI as production infrastructure:
Measure execution time, not guesses
Fail fast, not at minute 40
Cache intentionally, not blindly
Standardize build/test entry points
Enforce least-privilege and OIDC
Fast pipelines are not a “nice to have.”
 They are a developer productivity multiplier.
Currently refining secure, reliable GitHub Actions pipelines with an SRE mindset.
 Always open to discussions around CI architecture, scale, and reliability.
