#Day-55
Today I built a Highly Available Kubernetes Cluster on AWS using Terraform  fully modular, automated, and production-grade.

In this project I:
 👉 Created a custom VPC (3 AZs, public/private subnets)
 👉 Designed dedicated Security Groups for master, worker & HAProxy
 👉 Automated EC2 master/worker provisioning with reusable Terraform modules
 👉 Deployed HAProxy as the API load balancer (port 6443)
 👉 Used SSM + userdata for zero-touch kubeadm bootstrap
 👉 Achieved full cluster automation end-to-end
This setup mirrors how real companies build secure, scalable, multi-AZ Kubernetes clusters using Infrastructure as Code.
