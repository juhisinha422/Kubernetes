#Day-89 | Terraform State is Production Infrastructure.

If your Terraform state backend is:
Not versioned
Not encrypted
Not locked
Not audited
You are not doing DevOps.
 You are automating outages.

I documented how a serious Platform team should design a secure S3 backend for Terraform state:
Native S3 state locking (no DynamoDB hacks)
SSE-KMS encryption
Least-privilege IAM
CloudTrail auditing
Zero public access
Terraform state is your source of truth and a high-value attack target.
 Treat it with the same rigor as databases and secrets or accept the blast radius.
