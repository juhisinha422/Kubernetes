#Day-27

Today I explored how to set up a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04) using kubeadm, containerd, and Calico CNI for networking.
 
Key Learnings:

1) Understood the core components of Kubernetes — Control Plane, Worker Nodes, Kubelet, and Container Runtime.

2) Configured containerd with SystemdCgroup for better system resource management.

3) Installed and initialized the control plane, then joined worker nodes seamlessly.

4) Deployed Calico for pod networking and verified inter-pod communication.

5) Learned the critical network port configuration required for secure and smooth cluster communication.
