#Day-71   
Canary Deployments in Kubernetes with Argo Rollouts

Key concepts covered:
1) maxSurge: controls how many additional pods can be created during an update, enabling faster rollouts without sacrificing capacity.
2) maxUnavailable: defines how many pods can be taken offline during updates, ensuring availability is maintained.
3) Rolling Update Canary strategy with real-time visibility via the Argo Rollouts dashboard.

Designed for engineers who care about availability, safety, and production-grade deployments.
