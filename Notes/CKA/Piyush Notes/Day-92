Day-92 
Today I focused on Terraform Variable Design at Scale  moving beyond flat variables to structured, validated configurations that actually survive production environments.

Key Learnings (Scale & SRE Mindset):
1️⃣ Flat variables don’t scale → structured data does
 Using map and object types allows a single Terraform codebase to cleanly support dev, staging, and prod without copy-paste or conditionals.
2️⃣ One environment = one config object
 Instead of scattered variables, define complete environment definitions (map(object)), including CIDR, instance sizes, and feature flags.
 Cleaner inputs → safer deployments.
3️⃣ Locals are not optional  they’re a computation layer
 Locals help standardize naming, tags, and derived values.
 If the same string is built more than once, it belongs in locals.
4️⃣ Lists vs Sets matter more than people think
 Security rules and IAM principals should use set to avoid duplicates.
 Using the wrong type silently introduces risk.
5️⃣ Validation blocks prevent outages before they exist
 Validating environments, CIDRs, and allowed values ensures Terraform fails fast at plan time, not during deployment.
6️⃣ Zero hard-coding, zero environment branches
 No if env == prod logic spread across files.
 One design → many environments → predictable behavior.

Pro Tip:
 If your Terraform needs constant edits to support production, the problem isn’t Terraform it’s your variable design.
Infrastructure should break at validation, not at runtime.
