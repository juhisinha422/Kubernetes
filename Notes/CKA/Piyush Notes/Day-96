#Day-96 | Terraform Expressions (Simple, Practical, Useful)
Today I focused on Terraform Expressions small syntax features that make a big difference in real infrastructure code.
Why they matter
They help you avoid hardcoding, duplication, and messy configs.

Key takeaways:
1) Conditional expressions → change behavior based on environment
Example: smaller EC2 for dev, bigger for prod
2) Dynamic blocks → generate repeated nested blocks cleanly
Example: multiple security group rules without copy-paste
3) Splat expressions → extract values from multiple resources in one line
Example: get all EC2 instance IDs safely
Bottom line
If your Terraform feels repetitive or rigid, you’re probably not using expressions properly.
Clean code scales. Static code breaks.
