Day 85 | Terraform Isn’t About Tools. It’s About Scale.

Most people learn Terraform by memorizing commands.
That’s the wrong approach.
Terraform exists because manual infrastructure does not scale:
Not across environments
Not across teams
Not across hundreds of applications

Infrastructure as Code is about:
Consistency over convenience
Automation over heroics
Engineering discipline over ad-hoc fixes
Terraform is not “DevOps tooling.”
 It’s production infrastructure engineering.
Hands-on starts next. Foundations first. Always
