Day-73
Learning GitHub Actions (the right way)
Today I focused on GitHub Actions, not from a “copy-paste YAML” perspective, but from an engineering discipline standpoint.

What I worked on:
Designing workflows using standard GitHub Actions conventions
Structuring a monorepo with isolated learning modules (day73)
Implementing test workflows scoped to specific paths
Understanding when and why to use CI validation vs build automation
Learning the tradeoffs between GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI

The key takeaway:
1) CI/CD is not about tools. It’s about reducing risk, accelerating feedback, and enforcing consistency.
2) GitHub Actions stands out not because it’s perfect, but because:
CI lives next to the code
3) Integration with PRs, checks, and permissions is native

This is part of a long-term Cloud & DevOps learning track where the goal is job-ready skills, not surface-level familiarity.

I’m open to conversations around CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps engineering roles.
