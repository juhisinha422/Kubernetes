Fundamentals of Kubernetes (K8s) :
Why Kubernetes?

1. Managing a few containers manually is easy — but as applications grow, scaling, monitoring, and ensuring uptime becomes complex and expensive. Kubernetes automates it all.

2. Challenges with Plain Docker Containers:
Manual restarts when containers fail
No built-in scaling or self-healing
. Difficult load balancing and service discovery
High operational overhead for large applications

3.  What Kubernetes Takes Care Of:
Automated container orchestration
Load balancing and scaling
High availability and fault tolerance
Resource management and networking
Rolling updates with minimal downtime

4. When to Use (and Not Use) Kubernetes:
 Use it for enterprise or distributed systems with many containers.
 Avoid it for small apps — it adds unnecessary cost and complexity.

Key Takeaway:
Kubernetes solves the challenges of running containers at scale — providing automation, reliability, and efficiency — but it’s important to use it where it truly adds value.
