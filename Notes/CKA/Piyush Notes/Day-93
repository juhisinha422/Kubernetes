#Day-93
 Today I focused on Terraform Variable Types & Type Constraints  the part most people skip, and later pay for in production.

Key Learnings (Real-World Terraform):
1️⃣ Variables are defined by purpose and value
 Input, Output, and Locals exist for different reasons.
 Mixing them leads to fragile code.
2️⃣ Primitive types don’t scale complex types do
 Production Terraform relies on list, set, map, object, and tuple to model real infrastructure.
3️⃣ Lists vs Sets is a risk decision
 If duplicates are invalid (security rules, IAM principals), set is mandatory.
 Using list here is a silent failure.
4️⃣ Objects enforce intent, not just structure
 If your config has names, flags, and sizes, it belongs in an object not scattered variables.
5️⃣ any and null are escape hatches
 If you default to them, you skipped design.
 Type constraints exist to fail fast.

Pro Tip:
 If Terraform breaks only at apply time, your variable design already failed.
 Good infrastructure fails at validation, not in production.
