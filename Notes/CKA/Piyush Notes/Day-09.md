Day-09

Today, I explored the core of K8s networking. Services provide a stable abstraction layer, giving our ephemeral Pods a reliable endpoint and DNS name for discovery and load balancing.

1)  LoadBalancer: The main entry point, exposing our Nginx frontend to users on the internet. 
2)  ClusterIP: The internal glue, enabling secure communication between our frontend and backend (Node.js) Pods. 
3) NodePort: A way to expose the service on a static port on the worker node, great for debugging or specific use cases. 
4) ExternalName: A clever alias that lets our backend Pod connect to an external resource, like an AWS RDS database, using an internal service name.

The Flow: User (https://space9.com) -> LoadBalancer -> Frontend Pod -> Backend Pod -> External Database

Services are truly the networking backbone that makes a microservices architecture robust and decoupled in Kubernetes.

What are your go-to strategies for exposing applications in production? Share your insights ðŸ‘‡!
