#Day-47 

Today I explored the Kubernetes Gateway API, the modern way of routing traffic into applications running inside a cluster.

How things worked before (Ingress)
Earlier, we used an Ingress, where all traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) passed through an Ingress Controller, and routing depended heavily on vendor-specific annotations.

❌ Problems with Ingress:
Only supports HTTP/HTTPS
Hard to migrate between vendors (NGINX, Kong, Traefik all had different annotations)
Limited routing features
Not designed for large teams (infra + app teams working together)

🌉 What Gateway API Changes:
Gateway API is the next-gen traffic routing system.
 It supports:
HTTP / HTTPS
TCP / UDP
gRPC
Header-based routing
Method-based routing
Traffic splitting (canary rollout)
Standard YAML for all vendors
Better separation between Infra Team and App Teams
