Day-82 
Built & validated a manual Docker image release workflow using GitHub Actions
Today I implemented a clean, controlled CI workflow that builds and publishes Docker images for both backend and frontend services to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.

What this setup demonstrates:
Multi-service Docker builds from a single repository
Secure Docker Hub authentication using GitHub Secrets
Clear separation of backend and frontend build contexts
Reliable, repeatable image publishing with minimal moving parts
This exercise reinforced an important principle:
CI/CD pipelines should be predictable and deliberate not just automated for the sake of automation.
