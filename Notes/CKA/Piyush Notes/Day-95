Day-95
Today I worked on Terraform Lifecycle Meta-Arguments one of the most important but often ignored parts of Terraform.
Most Terraform incidents in production don’t happen because of bad code.
They happen because default lifecycle behavior was trusted blindly.

Key lifecycle rules that actually matter:
1) create_before_destroy:
Used to avoid downtime when a resource must be replaced (EC2, launch templates, AMI updates).
2) prevent_destroy:
A safety guardrail for critical resources like production databases, S3 buckets, and state backends.
3) ignore_changes:
Allows Terraform to coexist with auto scaling, policies, and external automation without constant drift.
4) replace_triggered_by:
Forces resource replacement when dependent resources change useful for immutable infrastructure.
5) precondition / postcondition:
Enforces validation and compliance directly in Terraform before and after resource creation.

Terraform lifecycle rules don’t change AWS or Azure.
They change how Terraform plans risk.
If you’re using Terraform in production and not using lifecycle rules, you’re leaving stability to chance.
