Day-60
Today I worked on setting up ArgoCD using both Custom Manifest installation and Helm-based installation, and clearly understood why Helm is the production-recommended approach for GitOps deployments in Kubernetes.


🚫 Challenges with Custom (Manifest) Installation:
 While great for learning and quick demos, custom installs come with limitations:
 ❌ No built-in upgrade management
 ❌ Hard to customize at scale
 ❌ Manual configuration overhead
 ❌ Limited production controls
 ❌ Not ideal for enterprise GitOps workflows
This makes it less suitable for long-term production environments.

✅ Why Helm Installation is Production-Recommended:
✅ Version-controlled deployments
 ✅ Easy upgrades & rollbacks
 ✅ Environment-specific configuration via values.yaml
 ✅ Production-grade scalability
 ✅ Better security & RBAC management
 ✅ Industry standard across DevOps teams
 ✅ Perfect fit for GitOps & CI/CD pipelines

🧩 Real-World Use Cases of Helm-Based ArgoCD:
 Helm-based ArgoCD is widely used for:
Multi-cluster GitOps management
Canary & blue-green deployments
Platform engineering automation
Secure enterprise Kubernetes delivery pipelines
