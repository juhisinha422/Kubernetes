Day-90 | Terraform + GitHub Actions (Production-grade IaC)
Today’s focus was running Terraform from GitHub Actions the right way not shortcuts, not hardcoded secrets.

What was implemented:
 • Terraform creates AWS resources (S3) via GitHub Actions
 • OIDC-based authentication no long-lived AWS keys
 • Least-privilege IAM role scoped only to what Terraform needs
 • Remote state with S3 + DynamoDB locking
 • Separated workflows for apply and destroy to enforce intent

Why this matters:
Infrastructure automation without security discipline is just automated risk.
Using OIDC with Terraform:
Eliminates credential sprawl
Reduces blast radius
Aligns with how real platform teams operate
Creation and destruction are explicit actions, not side effects.
This is not "Terraform basics".
 This is production-safe IaC execution.
