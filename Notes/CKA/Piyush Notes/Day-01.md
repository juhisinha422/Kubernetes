1.  Traditional deployment challenges: Multiple environments (Dev → Test → Prod) Issues like “It works on my machine”, missing dependencies, and environment Misconfiguration

2.   Why Containers?:
Package application code, dependencies, libraries, and OS image together
Ensure environment consistency across Dev, Test, and Prod
Lightweight, isolated, and scalable

3.   Docker Workflow: 
Dockerfile -> Docker Image -> Docker Container -> Docker Registry
Build once, ship anywhere, run anywhere

4.   Containers vs Virtual Machines: 
VMs = full house (heavy, slower, resource intensive)
Containers = apartment in shared building (lightweight, fast, efficient)

Key takeaway:
Containers with Docker simplify deployment, improve developer-ops collaboration, and optimize resource usage.
