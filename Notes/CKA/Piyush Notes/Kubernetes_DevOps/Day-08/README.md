# Day 08: High Availability with Controllers

Welcome to Day 8\! So far, we've learned how to deploy a Pod. But what happens if that Pod crashes or the node it's on fails? Our application would go down. To build robust, self-healing applications, Kubernetes provides controller objects that manage the lifecycle of Pods.

Today, we'll explore three fundamental controllers: **Replication Controller**, **ReplicaSet**, and the powerful **Deployment**.

-----

## What is a Controller?

In Kubernetes, a **controller** is a control loop that watches the state of your cluster and then makes or requests changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state. For example, if you desire to have 3 replicas of a Pod running, a controller will ensure that 3 replicas are always available.

-----

## ðŸ“œ Replication Controller (RC)

A **Replication Controller** is the original and now legacy controller responsible for ensuring that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time.

### Key Responsibilities:

  * **Auto-Healing:** If a Pod managed by the RC fails, crashes, or is deleted, the Replication Controller immediately spins up a new Pod to replace it.
  * **Desired State:** It guarantees that the desired number of Pods (the `replicas` count) is always running and available.
  * **Multi-Node Distribution:** If you have multiple nodes in your cluster, the RC can distribute the Pod replicas across them, improving fault tolerance.

Think of it as a manager that has been told, "I always need 3 copies of this application running." If it sees only 2, it hires a new one. If one crashes, it replaces it instantly.

> **Note:** Replication Controllers are considered legacy. You should use **ReplicaSets** (usually managed by a Deployment) instead.

-----

## âœ¨ ReplicaSet (RS)

A **ReplicaSet** is the next-generation Replication Controller. Its core purpose is identical to an RCâ€”to ensure a specified number of Pod replicas are running. The main improvement is its more expressive **selector** capabilities.

### Replication Controller vs. ReplicaSet

The key difference lies in how they identify the Pods to manage.

  * **Replication Controller:** Uses an *equality-based* selector. It can only match labels with exact values (e.g., `app: nginx`).
  * **ReplicaSet:** Uses a *set-based* selector. This allows for more complex rules, like matching Pods where a label is in a set of values (e.g., `environment in (production, qa)`).

This makes ReplicaSets more flexible, as they can manage Pods that they didn't necessarily create, as long as the Pod's labels match the selector.

### Scaling a ReplicaSet

You can easily scale the number of Pods in a ReplicaSet up or down. This is called manual scaling.

**To scale a ReplicaSet named `nginx-rs` to 10 replicas:**

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=10 rs/nginx-rs
```

**To edit the resource directly in the cluster:**
This command opens the resource's YAML configuration in your default editor.

```bash
kubectl edit rs nginx-rs
```

## ðŸš€ Deployments

While you can use ReplicaSets directly, you typically won't. Instead, you'll use a higher-level object called a **Deployment**. A Deployment manages ReplicaSets and provides powerful features for updating your applications without downtime.

**The hierarchy is simple:**
You create and manage a **Deployment**. The Deployment automatically creates a **ReplicaSet**. The ReplicaSet then creates and manages the **Pods**.

### Why Use Deployments?

The single most important feature of a Deployment is its ability to manage **application updates gracefully**.

Imagine you need to update your application's container image from `v1.1` to `v1.2`.

  * **Without a Deployment:** You might have to delete all old Pods and create new ones, causing downtime.
  * **With a Deployment:** You can perform a **rolling update**. The Deployment updates Pods one at a time. It ensures new Pods are healthy before terminating old ones, guaranteeing your application remains available to users during the update.

### Managing a Deployment

Here are the essential commands for managing your application rollouts. Let's assume you have a Deployment named `nginx-deploy`.

**1. Update the Container Image**
To update the image for the `nginx-deploy` container to version `1.9.1`:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deploy nginx-deploy=nginx:1.9.1
```

*`deployment/<deployment-name>` `container-name`=`new-image`*

**2. Check Rollout History**
You can see a history of all the revisions (updates) you've made.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deploy
```

**3. Roll Back to a Previous Version (Undo)**
If the new version has a bug, you can instantly roll back to the previous stable version with zero downtime.

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deploy'
```

**4. to check the apiVersion and kind**
```bash
kubectl explain deployment
```

**5. to check the apiVersion and kind for the replicationcontroller**
```bash
kubectl explain rc
```
**6. to check the apiVersion and kind for the replicasSet(rs)**
```bash
kubectl explain rs
```

**7. To create an template for the so you don need to write evrything from scrach**
```bash
kubectl create deploy deploy/deploy-new --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > deploy.yaml
```

## Summary Flow

The modern and recommended workflow for deploying a stateless application in Kubernetes follows this pattern:

```plaintext
      You
       |
     (manages)
       v
+--------------+       +----------------+       +-----------+
|  Deployment  |----->|   ReplicaSet   |----->|    Pod    |
+--------------+       +----------------+       +-----------+
                                                +-----------+
                                                |    Pod    |
                                                +-----------+
```

You define the desired state in the **Deployment** object, and Kubernetes handles the rest.
