# Terraform Fundamentals — Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Overview

This repository introduces **Terraform fundamentals** with a strong focus on **why Infrastructure as Code (IaC) exists**, **what problems it solves**, and **how Terraform works at a high level**.

Before writing a single Terraform configuration, it is critical to understand **the motivation behind IaC**. Without this context, Terraform becomes a set of commands rather than a reliable engineering practice.

This module establishes that foundation.

---

## What Is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of defining and managing infrastructure using **declarative configuration files**, rather than manually provisioning resources through cloud consoles or GUIs.

In simple terms:

* You **write code** to describe your infrastructure
* The tool **creates, updates, or destroys resources automatically**

Infrastructure can include:

* Compute (virtual machines, autoscaling groups)
* Networking (VPCs, subnets, firewalls, load balancers)
* Storage (object storage, block storage)
* Identity and access (IAM roles, policies)
* Databases and managed services

When infrastructure is defined as code, it becomes:

* Reproducible
* Version-controlled
* Auditable
* Automatable

---

## Why Terraform?

There are many IaC tools available, but **Terraform is the most widely adopted, cloud-agnostic solution**.

### Tool Categories

**Cloud-agnostic tools**

* Terraform
* Pulumi

**Cloud-specific tools**

* AWS: CloudFormation, CDK, SAM
* Azure: ARM Templates, Bicep
* GCP: Deployment Manager, Config Controller

### Why Terraform Is Chosen

Terraform is preferred because:

* It works across **multiple cloud providers**
* It has a **large ecosystem and community**
* It uses a **simple, readable configuration language**
* It scales well from small projects to enterprise environments

You do **not** need to learn every IaC tool.
Start with the one that gives you the **highest leverage**—Terraform.

## Why Not Just Use the Cloud Console?

Cloud consoles provide excellent GUIs, but they **do not scale operationally**.

To understand why, consider a **simple three-tier architecture**:

* Web tier (public-facing)
* Application tier
* Database tier

Even a basic setup involves:

* VPCs and networking
* Load balancers (external and internal)
* Multiple compute instances
* Databases with replicas
* DNS, health checks, and security rules

### Manual Provisioning Problems

Provisioning this manually:

* Takes hours for a single environment
* Becomes unmanageable with multiple environments:

  * Dev
  * Test
  * Performance
  * Staging
  * Production
  * Disaster Recovery

At enterprise scale:

* Organizations manage **hundreds or thousands of applications**
* Manual provisioning becomes **slow, error-prone, and expensive**

---

## Core Problems With Manual Infrastructure

1. **Time Inefficiency**

   * Infrastructure teams become bottlenecks
   * Other teams wait idle

2. **Human Error**

   * Inconsistent configurations
   * Missed security settings
   * Hard-to-debug production failures

3. **Inconsistency**

   * Dev and prod environments drift
   * “It works on my machine” becomes common

4. **Security Risks**

   * Manual steps increase the chance of misconfiguration

5. **Poor Auditability**

   * No clear history of who changed what and when

6. **High Operational Cost**

   * Skilled engineers spend time on repetitive tasks

---

## How Terraform Solves These Problems

Terraform replaces manual steps with **automation and consistency**.

### Key Benefits

* **Write once, deploy many times**
* **Consistent environments across all stages**
* **Rapid provisioning and teardown**
* **Lower operational costs**
* **Reduced human error**
* **Built-in change tracking via version control**

Non-production environments can be:

* Created on demand
* Destroyed when not needed
* Recreated identically at any time

---

## How Terraform Works (High-Level)

### Terraform Configuration Files

* Terraform uses files with a `.tf` extension
* Written in **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**
* Human-readable and declarative
* Not a traditional programming language

### Typical Workflow

1. **Write Terraform configuration**

   * Define infrastructure in `.tf` files

2. **Initialize**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

   * Downloads required providers
   * Prepares the working directory

3. **Validate**

   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

   * Checks syntax and configuration correctness

4. **Plan**

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   * Shows a preview of changes
   * No resources are modified

5. **Apply**

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   * Executes the planned changes
   * Creates, updates, or deletes resources

6. **Destroy**

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   * Removes all managed infrastructure

Terraform interacts with cloud platforms by calling their **APIs via providers**.
(Providers are covered in the next module.)

---

## Automation and CI/CD

Terraform can be executed:

* Manually via CLI
* Automatically via CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)

This enables:

* Infrastructure changes tied to code reviews
* Predictable, auditable deployments
* Zero manual intervention

---

## Version Control and Traceability

When Terraform code is stored in Git:

* Every infrastructure change is tracked
* Rollbacks are straightforward
* No ambiguity about ownership or responsibility

This eliminates:

* Configuration drift
* “Who changed this?” scenarios
* Manual post-incident forensics

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding:

* Basic AWS fundamentals
* Git installed
* VS Code or similar editor
* Basic Linux and shell scripting knowledge
* Familiarity with JSON/YAML (helpful but not mandatory)

---

## What’s Next

In the next module, we will cover:

* Terraform providers
* Version constraints
* Best practices for provider configuration
* Real hands-on infrastructure creation

From that point forward, the course becomes **fully practical**.

---

## Summary

Terraform is not about writing files.
It is about **operational scalability, reliability, and engineering discipline**.

If you understand *why* Terraform exists, *how* it works becomes straightforward.

Proceed to the next module only after this foundation is clear.
