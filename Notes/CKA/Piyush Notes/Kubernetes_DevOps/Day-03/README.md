##  Introduction

Welcome\! This project provides a hands-on example of a **multi-stage Docker build**. The goal is to take a standard React application, which requires a Node.js environment with many dependencies to build, and package it into a super lightweight Nginx container for production.

By following this guide, you'll learn one of the most effective techniques for optimizing your Docker images, leading to faster deployments, improved performance, and better security.

-----

##  Why Multi-Stage Builds?

So, why go through the trouble of a multi-stage build? The primary reason is **image size optimization**.

Imagine you have a final Docker image that's over 200MB. This image likely contains the base OS, the Node.js runtime, all the `node_modules` dependencies, and your source code. But for a production frontend application, you only need the static built files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a web server to serve them.

**Multi-stage builds solve this problem by:**

  * **Separating Concerns:** Using one stage (the "builder") with all the tools needed to build your app and a final, clean stage (the "runner") with only the necessary artifacts.
  * **Reducing Image Size:** The final image doesn't include build-time dependencies (`npm`, `node_modules`, etc.), making it significantly smaller.
  * **Improving Security:** A smaller attack surface, as fewer packages and tools are present in the final container.
  * **Boosting Performance:** Smaller images are faster to pull, push, and deploy.

-----

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

  * [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  * [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

-----

##  Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

First, clone the sample React application from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/todoapp-docker.git
cd todoapp-docker
```

### Step 2: Create the Dockerfile

Inside the project directory, create a new file named `Dockerfile`.

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

### Step 3: Add the Multi-Stage Build Instructions

Open the `Dockerfile` in your favorite editor and paste the following code. We'll break down what this does in the next section.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: The "Installer" or "Builder" Stage
# This stage installs dependencies and builds the React app.
FROM node:18-alpine AS installer

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json first to leverage Docker's layer caching.
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies.
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application's source code.
COPY . .

# Build the application for production.
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: The "Deployer" or "Runner" Stage
# This stage takes the built artifacts and serves them with Nginx.
FROM nginx:latest AS deployer

# Copy only the built assets from the 'installer' stage.
COPY --from=installer /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world. Nginx's default port.
EXPOSE 80

# The default command for the nginx image is to start the server.
# CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Step 4: Build the Docker Image

Now, let's build the image using the `docker build` command. We'll tag it as `multi-stage`.

```bash
docker build -t multi-stage .
```

You'll notice Docker pulls both `node:18-alpine` and `nginx:latest`, but the final image will be based only on the `nginx` image.

### Step 5: Run the Docker Container

Finally, run the container and map port `3000` on your host to port `80` inside the container.

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:80 multi-stage
```

> The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode.

You can now visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the running application\! üéâ

##  How It Works: Deconstructing the `Dockerfile`

Our `Dockerfile` has two distinct parts, each starting with a `FROM` instruction. Let's look at what each stage does.

### Stage 1: The `installer` Stage

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS installer
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
```

This is our **build environment**.

  * `FROM node:18-alpine AS installer`: We start with a lightweight Node.js image and name this stage `installer`. This name is a reference we can use later.
  * `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container.
  * `COPY` & `RUN npm install`: We copy the `package.json` files and install all the development dependencies needed to build our React app.
  * `RUN npm run build`: This command compiles our JavaScript and assets into a static `build` folder. At the end of this stage, we have everything needed for production inside `/app/build`.

### Stage 2: The `deployer` Stage

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest AS deployer
COPY --from=installer /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

This is our **final production environment**.

  * `FROM nginx:latest AS deployer`: We start fresh with a clean, lightweight Nginx image. This will be the base of our final container.
  * `COPY --from=installer /app/build ...`: This is the magic of multi-stage builds\! We copy **only the `/app/build` directory** from the previous `installer` stage into the Nginx public HTML directory (`/usr/share/nginx/html`).

The result is a tiny final image that contains only Nginx and our static application files. No `node_modules`, no source code, no `npm`‚Äîjust what's needed to serve the app.

-----

## üîç Inspecting the Final Container

Let's verify that our container is as lean as we expect.

First, find your container ID:

```bash
docker ps
```

Now, let's get a shell inside the running container:

```bash
docker exec -it <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID> sh
```

You are now inside the Nginx container. If you list the files in the directory where we copied our assets, you'll see only the production-ready files.

```bash
# Navigate to the web server's root directory
cd /usr/share/nginx/html

# List the files
ls
```

You should see an output like this, with no `node_modules` or `src` folder in sight\!

```
50x.html              favicon.ico           logo512.png
asset-manifest.json   index.html            manifest.json
robots.txt            logo192.png           static
```

This proves our multi-stage build was successful\!

##  Useful Docker Commands

Here's a quick reference for the commands used in this tutorial.

| Command                               | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docker build -t <tag> .`             | Builds a Docker image from a `Dockerfile` in the current directory.      |
| `docker run -d -p <host>:<cont> <tag>`| Runs a container in detached mode and maps ports.                        |
| `docker ps`                           | Lists all running containers.                                            |
| `docker images`                       | Lists all Docker images on your system.                                  |
| `docker exec -it <id> sh`             | Opens an interactive shell inside a running container.                   |
| `docker logs <id>`                    | Fetches the logs of a container.                                         |
| `docker inspect <id>`                 | Returns low-level information on Docker objects.                         |
| `docker stop <id>`                    | Stops one or more running containers.                                    |
| `docker rm <id>`                      | Removes one or more containers.                                          |

##  Best Practices

  * **Use a `.dockerignore` file:** Prevent unnecessary files like `node_modules`, `.git`, and `.env` from being copied into your build context, speeding up the build process.
  * **Run as a Non-Root User:** For better security, create a dedicated user and group in your `Dockerfile` to run the application instead of using the default `root` user.
  * **Leverage Layer Caching:** Structure your `Dockerfile` to take advantage of Docker's build cache. For example, copy `package.json` and run `npm install` before copying the rest of your source code.
  * **Keep Images Small:** Always start with the smallest, most appropriate base image (e.g., `alpine` variants).
