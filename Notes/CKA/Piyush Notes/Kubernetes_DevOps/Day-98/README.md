# Terraform Functions – Practical Guide with Real-World Use Cases

## Overview

This repository demonstrates **practical usage of Terraform built-in functions** to solve **real infrastructure problems**, not textbook examples.

The configuration focuses on:

* Data normalization and sanitization
* Environment-aware infrastructure decisions
* Cost aggregation and analysis
* Tag governance
* Input validation
* Safe handling of sensitive data
* Conditional configuration loading

If you cannot explain *why* these functions exist, you are not production-ready. This README fixes that.

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **String Normalization & Naming Standards**

#### Problem (Real Life)

Cloud resources **break or fail compliance** when:

* Names exceed AWS limits (S3 max 63 chars)
* Uppercase or spaces are used
* Special characters are present

#### Solution Used

```hcl
substr()
lower()
replace()
```

#### Implementation

```hcl
formatted_bucket_name = replace(
  replace(substr(lower(var.bucket_name), 0, 63), " ", ""),
  "!",
  ""
)
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Enforcing naming standards across teams
* Preventing CI/CD failures during resource creation
* Ensuring compatibility with AWS/GCP naming rules

If you ignore this in production, **your pipeline will fail at 2 AM**.

---

### 2. **Tag Governance Using `merge()`**

#### Problem

Different teams apply different tags. Finance, security, and ops all want control.

#### Solution

```hcl
new_tag = merge(var.default_tags, var.environment_tags)
```

#### Why This Matters

* Cost allocation (FinOps)
* Compliance audits
* Automated cleanup scripts
* SOC2 / ISO reporting

**If your tags are inconsistent, your cloud bill will be untraceable.**

---

### 3. **Dynamic Security Group Rules Using `split()` and `for` Expressions**

#### Problem

Hardcoding ports is fragile and error-prone.

#### Solution

```hcl
port_list = split(",", var.allowed_ports)

sg_rules = [
  for port in local.port_list : {
    name        = "port-${port}"
    port        = port
    description = "allow traffic on port ${port}"
  }
]
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Environment-specific firewall rules
* CI/CD-driven infrastructure
* Customer-specific port exposure

This is **exactly how** dynamic security groups are generated in real systems.

---

### 4. **Environment-Aware Infrastructure Decisions (`lookup`)**

#### Problem

Different environments require different instance sizes.

#### Solution

```hcl
instance_size = lookup(var.instance_sizes, var.environment, "t2.micro")
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Dev → cheap
* Staging → moderate
* Prod → expensive and reliable

Hardcoding instance types is **junior-level behavior**.

---

### 5. **List Operations: `concat()` and `toset()`**

#### Use Case

Aggregating regions from multiple sources.

```hcl
all_location    = concat(var.default_location, var.user_location)
unique_locations = toset(var.default_location)
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Multi-region deployments
* DR strategies
* Geo-redundancy planning

Using `toset()` avoids duplicate deployments and accidental double billing.

---

### 6. **Cost Calculations Using Math Functions**

#### Problem

Costs may include credits (negative values).

#### Solution

```hcl
positive_cost = [for cost in var.monthly_costs : abs(cost)]
max_cost      = max(local.positive_cost...)
min_cost      = min(local.positive_cost...)
total_cost    = sum(local.positive_cost)
avg_cost      = local.total_cost / length(local.positive_cost)
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Monthly cost dashboards
* Budget alerts
* Pre-billing analysis

If you can’t explain this, **you don’t understand FinOps**.

---

### 7. **Time-Based Naming & Backups**

#### Functions Used

```hcl
timestamp()
formatdate()
```

#### Example

```hcl
timestamp_name = "backup-${local.format1}"
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Backup rotation
* Snapshot naming
* Audit logs
* Disaster recovery

This prevents overwriting critical backups.

---

### 8. **Conditional File Loading (`fileexists`, `jsondecode`)**

#### Problem

Configuration files may not exist in all environments.

#### Solution

```hcl
config_file_exists = fileexists("./config.json")
config_data = local.config_file_exists ? jsondecode(file("./config.json")) : {}
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Feature flags
* Environment-specific overrides
* Secure external configuration

Blindly reading files is a **production outage waiting to happen**.

---

### 9. **Input Validation (Absolutely Mandatory)**

#### Example

```hcl
validation {
  condition     = can(regex("^t[2-3]\\.", var.instance_type))
  error_message = "instance type must start with t2 or t3"
}
```

#### Why This Matters

* Prevents invalid deployments
* Stops junior engineers from breaking prod
* Protects CI/CD pipelines

**Validation is not optional in professional Terraform.**

---

### 10. **Sensitive Outputs**

```hcl
output "credntials" {
  value     = var.credntials
  sensitive = true
}
```

#### Real-World Usage

* Secrets
* Tokens
* Passwords

If you output secrets without `sensitive = true`, you **failed basic security hygiene**.

---

## terraform.tfvars (Environment Overrides)

```hcl
environment    = "production"
instance_type  = "t2.micro"
backup_name    = "daily_backup"
```

This allows:

* Same codebase
* Multiple environments
* Zero duplication

---

## What This Project Actually Teaches

You are learning:

* How **real Terraform code looks**
* Why functions exist
* How production systems stay flexible
* How to avoid silent failures
* How to think like a DevOps engineer, not a script writer

---

## Hard Truths (Read Carefully)

* This is **not beginner Terraform**
* Interviewers expect you to explain *why*, not *what*
* If you copy this without understanding it, you will be exposed instantly
* Every function here exists because **someone got burned in production**

---

## Next Logical Improvements (If You’re Serious)

* Add `for_each`-based resources
* Convert into a reusable module
* Add `precondition` blocks
* Integrate with Terraform Cloud
* Add policy checks (OPA / Sentinel)
