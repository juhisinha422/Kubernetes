# Terraform State File Management

## Remote Backend with Amazon S3 (Native State Locking)

---

## Overview

Terraform relies on **state** to map real-world infrastructure to configuration code.
State management is **not optional** in production environments—it is the backbone of safe, predictable Infrastructure as Code.

This document explains:

* How Terraform updates infrastructure
* What the state file contains
* Why remote state is mandatory
* Differences between **DynamoDB-based locking** and **S3 Native State Locking**
* Advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs
* Enterprise-grade best practices

---

## How Terraform Updates Infrastructure

Terraform follows a **reconciliation model**:

* **Desired State** → Defined in `.tf` configuration
* **Actual State** → Stored in `terraform.tfstate`
* **Execution Model**:

  1. Read current state
  2. Compare with desired configuration
  3. Generate an execution plan
  4. Apply **only the required changes**

Terraform does **not** scan your cloud account blindly.
It trusts the **state file**. Corrupt state = unsafe automation.

---

## Terraform State File

The state file is a **JSON document** that contains:

* Resource IDs and metadata
* Provider-specific attributes
* Dependency graph
* Computed values (IPs, ARNs, endpoints)
* Sensitive data (often in plaintext unless encrypted)

This file is **critical infrastructure data**, not a local artifact.

---

## Why Remote State Is Mandatory (Non-Negotiable)

Local state fails immediately in real teams:

* No collaboration
* No locking
* High risk of corruption
* No audit trail
* No disaster recovery

**Remote state solves these problems.**

---

## Remote Backend with Amazon S3

### Core Components

* **S3 Bucket** – Stores the state file
* **S3 Versioning** – Required for rollback and locking
* **S3 Native State Locking** – Prevents concurrent writes
* **IAM Policies** – Access control
* **Encryption** – Data protection at rest and in transit

---

## S3 Native State Locking (Terraform ≥ 1.10)

### What Changed

Before Terraform 1.10:

* Locking required **DynamoDB**

From Terraform 1.10 onward:

* Terraform supports **native locking using S3 conditional writes**
* **DynamoDB is no longer required**
* DynamoDB locking is now **discouraged**

---

## How S3 Native Locking Works

* Terraform attempts to create a `.tflock` object in S3
* Uses **S3 Conditional Writes** (`If-None-Match`)
* If the lock already exists → operation fails
* If not → lock is acquired atomically
* On completion → lock object is deleted (versioned delete marker)

This is **atomic, simple, and reliable**.

## DynamoDB Locking vs S3 Native Locking

### Architectural Comparison

| Aspect               | DynamoDB Locking        | S3 Native Locking |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Extra Service        | Required                | Not required      |
| Setup Complexity     | High                    | Low               |
| Cost                 | DynamoDB RCU/WCU        | S3 only           |
| IAM Complexity       | S3 + DynamoDB           | S3 only           |
| Operational Overhead | Medium–High             | Low               |
| Failure Modes        | Table throttling, drift | Minimal           |
| Terraform Direction  | Deprecated path         | Recommended       |
| Atomicity            | Strong                  | Strong            |
| Versioning Support   | No                      | Yes               |

## Why State Locking Is Critical

Without locking:

* Two engineers run `terraform apply`
* Both read the same state
* Both compute different plans
* Last writer wins
* Infrastructure drift or corruption occurs

**State locking prevents concurrent mutation.**
No locking = unsafe automation.

---

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### S3 Native State Locking

**Advantages**

* Zero additional services
* Lower cost
* Simpler IAM
* Uses native AWS primitives
* Versioning-aware
* Official future path

**Disadvantages**

* Requires S3 versioning (mandatory)
* Terraform ≥ 1.10 required
* Less visibility compared to DynamoDB tables

---

### DynamoDB Locking (Legacy)

**Advantages**

* Explicit lock visibility
* Mature, battle-tested

**Disadvantages**

* Extra infrastructure
* Additional cost
* More IAM complexity
* Operational overhead
* Being phased out

**Verdict**: Do not use DynamoDB for new setups.

---

## Backend Configuration (Recommended)

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket       = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
    key          = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "us-east-1"
    use_lockfile = true
    encrypt      = true
  }
}
```

**Mandatory Requirements**

* S3 versioning enabled
* Encryption enabled
* IAM least privilege
* Terraform ≥ 1.10

---

## State File Best Practices (Production Standard)

### Absolute Rules

* Never edit state manually
* Never store state locally
* Never commit state to Git
* Never share state across environments

### Required Controls

* One state file per environment
* Enable S3 versioning
* Enable encryption at rest and transit
* Restrict IAM access
* Enable audit logging (CloudTrail)

### Operational Hygiene

* Regular backups (via versioning)
* Clear state ownership
* Controlled backend migration
* Explicit locking enabled

---

## State Management Commands (Use Carefully)

```bash
terraform state list
terraform state show <resource>
terraform state rm <resource>
terraform state mv <source> <destination>
terraform state pull
```

⚠️ These commands **bypass normal lifecycle safety**.
Use only when you fully understand the consequences.

---

## Common Failure Scenarios

| Issue                   | Root Cause             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Lock acquisition error  | Concurrent apply       |
| 412 Precondition Failed | Lock already held      |
| Lock stuck              | Crashed Terraform run  |
| Permission denied       | Missing S3 IAM actions |
| Lock not working        | Versioning disabled    |
| Backend init failure    | Region mismatch        |

Recovery:

```bash
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
```

Use **only when you are certain no operation is running**.

---

## Security Considerations

* State contains secrets → treat it as sensitive data
* Restrict bucket access tightly
* Enable encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
* Enable CloudTrail logging
* Do not grant wildcard S3 permissions

---

## Final Recommendation

If you are still using DynamoDB for state locking:

* You are carrying **unnecessary complexity**
* You are paying for **obsolete architecture**
* You are ignoring Terraform’s official direction

**S3 Native State Locking is the correct choice for all new Terraform backends.**

---

## Next Steps

* Proceed to variables and modular design
* Enforce environment isolation
* Standardize backend configuration across repositories
* Treat state as production data—not a side effect
