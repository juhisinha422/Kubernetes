# Designing GitHub Actions Workflows the SRE Way

**Fault-Tolerant • Observable • Disaster-Recoverable CI/CD**

## Why This Exists

Most CI/CD workflows are written to **pass**, not to **survive failure**.

In SRE terms, that’s a problem.

A GitHub Actions workflow is **production infrastructure**:

* It deploys production code
* It holds production credentials
* It can take production systems down

This document outlines how to design GitHub Actions workflows using **SRE principles**, so failures are **contained**, **observable**, and **recoverable**.

---

## Core SRE Principle Applied to CI/CD

> A system is reliable not because it never fails,
> but because failure is **expected, isolated, and recoverable**.

Your workflow must be designed the same way.

---

## 1. Job Isolation (Failure Containment)

### Problem

Monolithic workflows fail catastrophically. One bad step poisons everything.

### SRE Approach

**Each job represents a failure domain.**

### Design Rules

* Build, test, security, and deploy **must be separate jobs**
* Jobs communicate only through **artifacts or outputs**
* No shared mutable state across jobs

### Result

A failed test job:

* Does **not** invalidate build artifacts
* Does **not** re-run expensive build steps
* Produces clear failure signals

---

## 2. Fail Fast, Not Late

### Problem

Pipelines that fail at deploy waste time, money, and trust.

### SRE Approach

Optimize for **early signal**, not green dashboards.

### Design Rules

* Order jobs by **cheapest → most expensive**
* Lint → unit tests → integration → build → deploy
* Block downstream jobs explicitly using `needs`

### Result

Bad commits fail in minutes, not 20+ minutes.

---

## 3. Idempotency (Disaster Recovery Requirement)

### Problem

Re-running workflows often makes things worse.

### SRE Truth

If a job cannot be safely re-run, it is **not production-safe**.

### Design Rules

* Builds must be deterministic
* Artifact names must be immutable
* Deploy jobs must tolerate retries
* Never assume “first run only”

### Result

You can safely:

* Re-run failed jobs
* Resume partial pipelines
* Recover from runner or network failure

---

## 4. Immutable Artifacts (Rollback Safety)

### Problem

Mutable tags like `latest` destroy rollback guarantees.

### SRE Approach

**Artifacts are immutable. Deployments are references.**

### Design Rules

* Tag images with commit SHA or build ID
* Never rebuild the same tag
* Promote artifacts, don’t rebuild them

### Result

Rollbacks become:

* Fast
* Predictable
* Auditable

---

## 5. Least Privilege per Job (Blast Radius Control)

### Problem

Default permissions expose more than necessary.

### SRE Approach

Minimize blast radius **per job**, not per workflow.

### Design Rules

* Explicit `permissions` block on every job
* Separate credentials for build vs deploy
* No long-lived secrets when short-lived tokens are possible

### Result

A compromised job cannot escalate laterally.

---

## 6. Observability Inside the Workflow

### Problem

Most workflows fail silently or ambiguously.

### SRE Requirement

If you cannot explain **why** it failed, the system is unreliable.

### Design Rules

* Log timestamps for critical steps
* Surface step duration
* Group logs by responsibility
* Make failure reasons explicit

### Result

Debugging becomes **diagnosis**, not guesswork.

---

## 7. Graceful Degradation (Non-Critical Jobs)

### Problem

Optional steps blocking critical paths.

### SRE Approach

Not all failures are equal.

### Design Rules

* Security scans may warn but not block (context-dependent)
* Notifications must never fail deployments
* Use `continue-on-error` intentionally, not lazily

### Result

Critical delivery continues while non-critical signals are preserved.

---

## 8. Explicit Recovery Paths

### Problem

After failure, engineers ask: *“What now?”*

### SRE Approach

Recovery must be **designed**, not improvised.

### Design Rules

* Document rerun strategy
* Define which jobs are safe to retry
* Preserve artifacts for post-mortem

### Result

Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) drops significantly.

---

## Final Thought

A GitHub Actions workflow is not YAML glue.

It is:

* A distributed system
* With credentials
* With failure modes
* With real blast radius

If you don’t design it like an SRE,
it will eventually fail like an amateur system.

---

## Status

This repository documents **design principles**, not just syntax.
The workflow will continue evolving toward:

* Stronger isolation
* Better observability
* Safer recovery guarantees
