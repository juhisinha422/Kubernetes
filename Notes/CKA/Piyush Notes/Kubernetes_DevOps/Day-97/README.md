# Day-97: Terraform Functions — Practical Usage Guide (AWS-Focused)

## Overview

Terraform functions are **not optional knowledge**. If you cannot read, reason about, and combine functions, you are not writing production Terraform—you are writing glorified copy-paste IaC.

This module is a **hands-on, opinionated guide** to Terraform built-in functions, focused on **real AWS use cases**, **failure prevention**, and **configuration hygiene**.

You will not just learn *what* functions exist.
You will learn:
- **Why they exist**
- **When to use which one**
- **When NOT to use them**
- **How bad Terraform code looks without them**

This guide spans **12 focused assignments** mapped to real infrastructure problems.

---

## Why Terraform Functions Matter (No Sugarcoating)

If you avoid functions:
- Your variables become unvalidated garbage
- Your resource names break AWS constraints
- Your configs become environment-specific and unscalable
- Your plans fail late instead of early
- Your teammates silently hate your code

Terraform functions allow you to:
- Enforce correctness **before apply**
- Normalize user input
- Prevent invalid infrastructure states
- Write reusable, environment-agnostic modules
- Catch errors in `terraform plan`, not in AWS

If you are aiming for **mid/senior DevOps roles**, this is table stakes.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Use Terraform functions **intentionally**, not randomly
- Combine multiple functions to solve real problems
- Validate inputs without external tools
- Handle sensitive data correctly
- Sanitize and normalize AWS resource names
- Use `terraform console` like a professional, not a beginner
- Read other people’s Terraform code without confusion

---

## Mandatory Tool: Terraform Console

If you are not using `terraform console`, you are learning Terraform incorrectly.

Run this **before every assignment**:

```bash
terraform console
````

### Examples You Should Test (Not Optional)

```hcl
lower("HELLO WORLD")
replace("Project Alpha", " ", "-")
max(5, 12, 9)
trim("  hello  ")
chomp("hello\n")
reverse(["a", "b", "c"])
```

If these confuse you, stop and fix that first.
---

## Terraform Function Categories (With Real Guidance)

### 1. String Functions

**Functions:**
`lower`, `upper`, `replace`, `substr`, `trim`, `split`, `join`, `chomp`

**When to use:**

* Enforcing AWS naming constraints
* Normalizing user-provided input
* Building tags, names, identifiers

**Real example (S3 bucket naming):**

```hcl
bucket = lower(replace(var.project_name, " ", "-"))
```

If you skip this, AWS will reject your resource.

---

### 2. Numeric Functions

**Functions:**
`abs`, `max`, `min`, `ceil`, `floor`, `sum`

**When to use:**

* Cost calculations
* Resource sizing guards
* Preventing negative or zero values

**Example (cost with credits):**

```hcl
final_cost = max(0, sum(var.monthly_costs))
```

This avoids negative billing values—something juniors forget.

---

### 3. Collection Functions

**Functions:**
`length`, `concat`, `merge`, `reverse`, `toset`, `tolist`

**When to use:**

* Merging tags
* Removing duplicates
* Handling dynamic lists/maps

**Example (tag strategy):**

```hcl
tags = merge(var.default_tags, var.env_tags)
```

Hardcoding tags is amateur behavior.

---

### 4. Type Conversion

**Functions:**
`tonumber`, `tostring`, `tobool`, `toset`, `tolist`

**When to use:**

* Dealing with module inputs
* Preventing implicit type errors
* Writing defensive Terraform

If you rely on Terraform’s implicit conversion, you are gambling.

---

### 5. File Functions

**Functions:**
`file`, `fileexists`, `dirname`, `basename`

**When to use:**

* Reading configs
* Conditional logic based on file presence
* Externalized configuration

**Example:**

```hcl
count = fileexists(var.config_path) ? 1 : 0
```

This avoids runtime crashes.

---

### 6. Date and Time Functions

**Functions:**
`timestamp`, `formatdate`, `timeadd`

**When to use:**

* Resource versioning
* Audit tags
* Backup naming

**Example:**

```hcl
tags = {
  created_at = formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD", timestamp())
}
```

If your infra has no timestamps, debugging becomes guesswork.

---

### 7. Validation and Guard Functions

**Functions:**
`can`, `regex`, `contains`, `startswith`, `endswith`

**When to use:**

* Validating instance types
* Preventing invalid user input
* Failing early

**Example:**

```hcl
can(regex("^t3\\.", var.instance_type))
```

Fail fast. Always.

---

### 8. Lookup Functions

**Functions:**
`lookup`, `element`, `index`

**When to use:**

* Environment-based configuration
* Default fallbacks

**Example:**

```hcl
instance_type = lookup(var.env_map, var.environment, "t3.micro")
```

Hardcoding environment logic is not scalable.

---

## Assignment Highlights (Why They Matter)

### Assignment 6: Instance Validation (Critical)

If you cannot validate input formats, your Terraform code is unsafe.

### Assignment 12: File + JSON Handling

This is real-world Terraform:

* Reading config files
* Parsing JSON
* Passing secrets safely

If this scares you, you are not production-ready yet.

## Best Practices (Non-Negotiable)

* Always validate inputs (`can`, `regex`)
* Normalize names before using them
* Use `terraform console` aggressively
* Prefer functions over hardcoded logic
* Fail during `plan`, not `apply`
* Never store secrets without `sensitive()`
* Avoid implicit type conversion

Ignore these and your Terraform will rot.
