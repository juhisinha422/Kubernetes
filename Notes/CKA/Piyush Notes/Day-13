#Day-13
 
one of the most fascinating parts of Kubernetes 

üß† Key takeaways:
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Static Pods ‚Äî critical control plane components like etcd, kube-apiserver, controller-manager, and scheduler run as static pods managed directly by kubelet, not the scheduler.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Scheduling ‚Äî you can manually assign a pod to a specific node using nodeName when the scheduler isn‚Äôt running.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Labels & Selectors ‚Äî help organize and filter thousands of Kubernetes resources efficiently.
 4Ô∏è‚É£ Annotations ‚Äî store metadata for better debugging and version tracking.

These concepts form the backbone of Kubernetes control and orchestration ‚Äî knowing how the scheduler schedules itself truly deepens your DevOps understanding!"
