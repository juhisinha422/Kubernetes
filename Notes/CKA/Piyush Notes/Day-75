Day -75  
Advanced GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is more than YAML glue.

Today I went deep into:
Runner strategies (GitHub-hosted vs third-party vs self-hosted)
Containers on runners
Artifacts vs caches (and when each actually makes sense)
Performance trade-offs and cost implications
Tight permission scoping with GITHUB_TOKEN
The difference between “CI that works” and “CI that scales” is how intentionally you design these pieces.
I’m actively exploring DevOps / Cloud / Platform Engineering roles where build performance, security, and reliability actually matter not just green checkmarks.
