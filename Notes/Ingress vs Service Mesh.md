Ingress vs Service Mesh: The battle of Kubernetes traffic control. One rules the edge. The other rules everything inside.

In Kubernetes, Ingress and Service Mesh both are used for managing traffic, but in fundamentally different scopes. With the help of a simple illustration Let’s understand how they are different.

𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 handles North-South traffic, which means it manages external client requests entering the cluster. It offers features like host/path-based routing, TLS termination, and basic auth. You can think of it as the gatekeeper of your Kubernetes environment.


𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝗵, on the other hand, is used to manage East-West traffic, which means it controls the internal communication between services. It introduces sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy) to handle secure (mTLS), observable, and reliable communication.
