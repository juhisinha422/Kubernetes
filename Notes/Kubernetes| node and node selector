kubernetes | Nodes and Node selector

A kubernetes node is a physical or virtual machine that functions as worker machine that provides the compute services to run the containerized applications.

A single worker node might not have enough resources to handle the load of all the pods. Adding more worker nodes allows you to distribute the workload across the worker nodes.

Command to list the nodes is
kubectl get nodes

Node selector:
     Node selector is a machanism used to control the placement of pods onto a specific nodes within the cluster.

Under spec section in manifest file we can mention node selector. So, if you know a pod takes huge amount of resources then we can mention size as large so that pod is only deployed to large node.

Now the question is how does kubernetes know that it is micro, medium and large?
You will be assigning a label to each worker node so that to select that particular node.

Why use node selector?
1) To ensure certain workloads run on a specific nodes with special hardware or configuration.
2) To segregate workloads for complaince, performance or isolation purposes
