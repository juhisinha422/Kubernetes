🌐 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟯: 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀 – 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀

Welcome to Day 23 of my 30 Days of Kubernetes series!

Today’s focus is one of the most critical components for production workloads in Kubernetes:
Ingress and Ingress Controllers – the gateway for getting external traffic into your cluster.

🚪 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀?
An Ingress is a Kubernetes API object that manages external access to your services, typically over HTTP or HTTPS.

It acts as a reverse proxy, allowing you to:
 • Route traffic to different services based on URL paths or domains
 • Terminate TLS/SSL
 • Implement authentication, rate limiting, redirects, and more

Instead of exposing every service using a LoadBalancer or NodePort, you can manage everything through a single entry point.

⚙️ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿?
While Ingress defines the rules, the Ingress Controller is the actual implementation that enforces them.

Popular Ingress Controllers include:
 • NGINX Ingress Controller
 • Traefik
 • HAProxy
 • Istio Gateway (when using service mesh)
 • AWS ALB Ingress Controller (for EKS)

Without an Ingress Controller running in your cluster, Ingress resources won’t do anything—they're just config.

🧩 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀
 • Path-based routing (e.g., /app1 → Service A, /app2 → Service B)
 • Host-based routing (e.g., app.company.com)
 • TLS termination
 • Custom rules and annotations for advanced behavior
 • Authentication mechanisms like basic auth or OAuth (via plugins)

🧠 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲
Let’s say you're running:
 • A frontend app at example.com
 • A backend API at example.com/api
 • A monitoring dashboard at example.com/monitoring

Instead of exposing each via separate services and IPs, you define a single Ingress that routes traffic to the correct backend based on the path.

This simplifies DNS, networking, and access control.

🛡️ 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
 • Always enable TLS with a trusted certificate (e.g., using cert-manager + Let’s Encrypt).
 • Don’t expose sensitive internal services unless necessary.
 • Use rate limiting and IP whitelisting when possible.
 • Monitor Ingress traffic for anomalies or misuse.

✅ 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆
Ingress is your cluster’s front door. With Ingress Controllers, you gain powerful control over HTTP/HTTPS traffic without complicating service exposure.

It enables scalability, better routing, centralized security, and reduced cloud costs (fewer LoadBalancers!).
