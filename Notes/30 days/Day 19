🔄 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭𝟵: 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀
Welcome to Day 19 of our Kubernetes series! Yesterday, we looked at autoscaling with HPA. Today, we're shifting gears to something equally critical for application lifecycle management — Rolling Updates and Rollbacks.

Let’s talk about safe deployments, zero downtime, and quick recovery.

🚀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘀 𝗮 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲?
When you update your application (like deploying a new container image), Kubernetes doesn't take down all your pods at once. Instead, it gradually replaces old pods with new ones, ensuring there's always a minimum number of healthy instances running.
This approach is called a Rolling Update.

Benefits:
 • Zero downtime deployments
 • Controlled rollout speed
 • Automatic health checks during deployment

🕹️ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀
Kubernetes handles rolling updates by:
 • Launching new pods with the updated spec
 • Waiting for them to become healthy
 • Gradually terminating the old pods

You can control the process using deployment settings like:
 • MaxUnavailable: How many old pods can be down during the update
 • MaxSurge: How many extra new pods can run temporarily

⏪ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘀?
Not every update goes as planned.
If something goes wrong — say your app crashes or a bug sneaks in — Kubernetes lets you roll back to the previous version instantly.

With a simple command or API call, Kubernetes will:
 • Revert the deployment to the last known good configuration
 • Reapply the old pod template
 • Restart the rollout process safely

🔐 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
 • You get safe and predictable deployments
 • Issues can be quickly rolled back without downtime
 • Teams can adopt CI/CD pipelines with confidence
