Containers are usually built from pre-existing images on Docker Hub, but in real-world development, you’ll often need to build your own custom images — that’s where the Dockerfile comes in.

🛠️ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲?
A Dockerfile is a plain text file that contains a set of instructions Docker uses to build a custom image. Think of it as a recipe — it tells Docker exactly what to install, copy, and configure inside the image.

Let’s say you have a small Python app (app.py). Your Dockerfile might look like this:
---
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the local code to the container
COPY app.py .

# Run the Python app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
---

To build an image from this Dockerfile, run:

$ docker build -t my-python-app .
 • -t: Tags the image with a name
 • . : Specifies the current directory (where Dockerfile resides)

This command reads the Dockerfile, executes each instruction, and creates a new image called my-python-app.

🚀 𝗥𝘂𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿

Now that your image is built, start a container:
$ docker run my-python-app
This launches a container from the custom image and runs your Python script automatically.

The Dockerfile enables:

 • Version-controlled, repeatable builds
 • Customization for dependencies, tools, and runtime configs
 • Seamless CI/CD and production deployments

Every production-grade container image starts with a well-defined Dockerfile. Mastering this step puts you in control of your app’s environment.
