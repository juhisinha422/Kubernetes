Day 6 of 60: Moving from "What is Kubernetes?" to "I built a cluster!" 🏗️

Today was a big step in my hashtag#60DaysOfK8s challenge. Instead of clicking buttons in a Cloud Portal, I went under the hood. 🔧

I used Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) to spin up a local multi-node cluster.

Why locally? 

Because managed services like EKS or GKE are great, but they hide the control plane. To pass the CKA and actually understand K8s, you need to see the "brain" of the operation.

Today’s Wins:

✅ Configured a multi-node setup (1 Control Plane, 2 Workers) via YAML. 

✅ Mastered kubectl config use-context to jump between clusters. 

✅ Navigated the official K8s documentation like a pro.
