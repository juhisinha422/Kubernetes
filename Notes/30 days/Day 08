𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟴: 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀? 🚢

After hitting Docker’s limitations, we need something to orchestrate and manage containers at scale — that’s where Kubernetes comes in!

🧠 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀?
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates:
 • Deployment
 • Scaling
 • Management
 • Networking
 • Availability
...of containerized applications.

🌐 𝗪𝗵𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝘁?
Originally designed by Google, now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

⚙️ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀:
✅ Automatically restarts failed containers
✅ Distributes traffic with built-in load balancing
✅ Makes app updates safe using rolling updates
✅ Ensures desired state via declarative configs (YAML)
✅ Handles networking and service discovery
✅ Works across multi-node, multi-cloud environments

Think of Kubernetes as the operating system for your containerized infrastructure.
