What is Containerization? Why Containers?
In the traditional world, running applications meant installing them directly on the host OS. This often led to the "it works on my machine" problem due to differences in environments.
Containerization solves this.
🔹 A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, libraries, system tools, and settings.
Think of it like a portable box that runs your app the same way, anywhere—on your laptop, in the cloud, or in production.

⚙️ Why Containers?
Here are some core benefits:
🔁 Consistency: Same environment across dev, test, and production
🧳 Portability: Runs anywhere a container runtime is available
📦 Isolation: Apps run independently from one another
🚀 Lightweight: Faster startup compared to VMs
📈 Scalability: Ideal for microservices and cloud-native apps

In simple terms, containers are the building blocks of modern software delivery — and Kubernetes is the system that manages them at scale. 🌍
