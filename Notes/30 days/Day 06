𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟲: 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲
When building modern applications, you often need to run multiple containers — like a web app, a database, and maybe a cache. Managing them individually using docker run can quickly get messy.

That’s where 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲 comes in.

📄 Sample docker-compose.yml File
Here’s a simple example with a Python Flask app and a Redis service:

---
version: '3'

services:
 web:
  build: .
  ports:
   - "5000:5000"
 redis:
  image: "redis:alpine"

 • The web service is built from the current directory (must contain a Dockerfile)

 • The redis service uses an official image from Docker Hub

▶️ 𝗥𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝗲
To launch the entire app:
$ docker-compose up

This:
Builds any needed images
Creates containers
Sets up networking between them

To stop everything:
$ docker-compose down

🔍 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲
 • Declarative setup — your entire stack lives in one YAML file
 • Simplified networking — containers can talk to each other by service name
 • Scalable — supports scaling services for testing
 • Reusable — easily share with teammates and CI/CD pipelines

🧠 𝗣𝗿𝗼 𝗧𝗶𝗽
You can define volumes, environment variables, health checks, and more in your Compose file. It’s a powerful stepping stone before transitioning to orchestrators like Kubernetes.
