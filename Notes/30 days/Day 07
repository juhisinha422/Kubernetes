𝐃𝐚𝐲 𝟕: 𝐋𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫 (𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬?)

Docker revolutionized how we package and run applications. But as you scale, you start hitting its limitations. Here’s why we need something more — like Kubernetes.

𝟏. 𝐍𝐨 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭-𝐢𝐧 𝐎𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Docker can run individual containers, but it doesn't manage multiple containers across multiple hosts. You need orchestration for:

 • Auto-restarting failed containers
 • Scaling up/down
 • Load balancing
 • Rolling updates

𝟮. 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴
Want 10 instances of your app? You’ll need to script it yourself or use docker-compose, which is limited and not production-grade.

𝟯. 𝗟𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆
Docker alone doesn’t provide a native way for containers to discover and communicate with each other across hosts.

𝟰. 𝗡𝗼 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴
While you can expose container ports, Docker doesn’t handle incoming traffic load distribution.

𝟱. 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗛𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴
Cross-node networking with Docker requires extra tools or plugins. It’s not seamless out-of-the-box.

𝟲. 𝗡𝗼 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁-𝗶𝗻 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴
You have to integrate external tools for tracking container health, resource usage, and logs.

𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 — a powerful container orchestration platform that handles all of the above and more, making it the de facto standard for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale.
