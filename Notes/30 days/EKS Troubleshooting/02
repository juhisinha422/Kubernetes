EKS Troubleshooting – A Practical Guide (Part 2/4)

🌐 4. Pods are running but traffic is not reaching
Validate the chain:

kubectl get svc
kubectl get endpoints
kubectl get ingress

Check:

Does service have endpoints?
Do endpoints match pod IPs?
Does ingress point to correct service and port?

EKS specific:

Node security group allows traffic from load balancer
NodePort range allowed
Load balancer health check path is correct
Target group shows healthy targets

👉 Very common mistake
 Service port ≠ containerPort

🧱 5. Service works inside cluster but not outside
Test inside cluster:

kubectl run test --image=busybox -it --rm -- sh
wget http://<service-name>:<port>
If it works internally:
Check ingress annotations
Check LB listeners
Check security groups
Check target group health

🧭 6. DNS problems inside EKS

Symptoms:

Services cannot resolve each other
External DNS fails

Checks:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/coredns

Common causes:

CoreDNS pods not running
Node-to-node traffic blocked
NetworkPolicy blocking DNS

🕸️ 7. Pod-to-Pod networking failures

Important EKS fact:
 Pods receive IPs from VPC CIDR.

Check:
Subnet IP exhaustion
VPC CNI health
Security groups
Network policies

kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep aws-node
