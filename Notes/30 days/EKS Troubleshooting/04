EKS Troubleshooting – A Practical Guide (Part 4/4)

⚖️ 12. Autoscaling not working

HPA side:

kubectl describe hpa
Common issues:
metrics-server missing
resource requests not defined
wrong target metrics
Cluster Autoscaler side:
Node group min/max wrong
Missing IAM permissions
nodeSelector / affinity blocking scale-out

🛑 13. Rolling deployment breaks live traffic

Verify:

readinessProbe is correct
maxUnavailable is too aggressive
ALB/NLB deregistration delay
App is not really ready when pod becomes Ready
👉 Most deployment outages are caused by bad readiness probes.

🧪 14. One-minute on-call checklist

kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get svc,ingress
kubectl describe pod <bad-pod>
kubectl logs <bad-pod> --previous

🏁 Final mindset (what interviewers really look for)
EKS troubleshooting is not about commands.

It is about:
✅ understanding the traffic path
 ✅ understanding AWS networking boundaries
 ✅ understanding Kubernetes control flow
 ✅ separating platform problems from application failures
Memorize this rule:
Always troubleshoot EKS in layers — not in tools.
