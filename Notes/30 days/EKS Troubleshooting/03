EKS Troubleshooting – A Practical Guide (Part 3/4)

🧍 8. Node is NotReady

kubectl describe node <node>

Look for:

Kubelet not posting status
Disk pressure
Memory pressure
Real EKS causes:
Instance lost network
Disk full
Bootstrap failure
AMI mismatch with cluster version

🔐 9. IAM & permission failures (very common)

Typical failures:
Pod cannot access S3, SQS, Secrets Manager
AccessDenied errors

Validate:
Is IRSA used?
Is service account annotated?
Is trust policy correct?

kubectl get sa <sa> -o yaml
👉 One missing annotation can cause a full outage.
📦 10. ConfigMap / Secret issues

Symptoms:
App starts but behaves wrongly
App cannot read config
Checks:

kubectl describe pod <pod>
kubectl get cm
kubectl get secret

Look for:
Wrong key
Wrong mount path
Wrong namespace

📈 11. High latency but CPU and memory are normal

Experienced engineers check:

Downstream dependency latency
DB connection pool exhaustion
Thread pool limits
Ingress network hops
TLS handshake overhead
👉 Metrics alone never explain latency.
 You must inspect the request path.
