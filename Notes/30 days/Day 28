📊 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟴: 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘂𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗮𝗻𝗮 – 𝗢𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗠𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲
Welcome to Day 28 of my 30 Days of Kubernetes series!

We’ve covered how to deploy, scale, secure, and automate workloads in Kubernetes. But how do you know what’s actually happening inside your cluster?

That’s where monitoring comes in—and two names stand out:
Prometheus and Grafana.

Let’s explore how they bring observability to your Kubernetes world.

🧠 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
In a dynamic environment like Kubernetes, things break, autoscale, and reschedule all the time.
Without proper visibility, debugging becomes guesswork.
Monitoring gives you:
 • Real-time visibility into cluster health
 • Alerting for critical failures
 • Capacity planning with metrics over time
 • Dashboards for developers and SREs alike

🕵️ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘂𝘀 – 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲
Prometheus is a powerful open-source metrics collection and alerting system.
It was built for dynamic environments like Kubernetes.
Key features:
 • Pull-based metrics collection over HTTP (/metrics endpoint)
 • Time-series database built in
 • Service discovery (automatically finds pods and services)
 • Powerful PromQL query language
 • Alertmanager integration for email, Slack, PagerDuty alerts

In Kubernetes, it scrapes data from:
 • Node exporters (CPU, memory, disk)
 • Kubelet, API server, scheduler
 • Application pods exposing custom metrics
 • Exporters (e.g., for MySQL, Redis)

📈 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗮𝗻𝗮 – 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿
While Prometheus stores the data, Grafana brings it to life.
With Grafana, you can:
 • Build real-time dashboards from Prometheus metrics
 • Visualize pod resource usage, request rates, error rates, and more
 • Set up alerts visually
 • Import thousands of ready-to-use dashboards from the Grafana community

It's fully extensible with plugins, themes, and multiple data sources.

🔧 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵
 • CPU / memory usage per pod, node, and namespace
 • Pod restart counts and container failures
 • Request/response latencies
 • Error rates
 • Disk I/O and network throughput
 • Kubernetes component health

🚀 𝗚𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱
 • You can deploy Prometheus + Grafana in Kubernetes using:
 • Prometheus Operator (most robust, includes CRDs)
 • kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart (quick setup with dashboards)
 • Custom setup with ConfigMaps and ServiceMonitors

✅ 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆
Prometheus and Grafana are the go-to combo for Kubernetes monitoring.
Prometheus collects and stores metrics. Grafana visualizes and alerts on them.
Together, they turn your cluster into a transparent, observable system—not a black box.
Monitoring isn’t just about fixing issues—it's about preventing them and scaling with confidence.
