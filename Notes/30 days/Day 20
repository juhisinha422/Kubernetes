🧙‍♂️ 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟬: 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 – 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀
Welcome to Day 20 of our hashtag#Kubernetes learning journey!

After exploring updates and rollbacks yesterday, today we introduce a tool that simplifies managing Kubernetes applications at scale — Helm.

📦 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘀 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺?
Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. Think of it like apt for Ubuntu or yum for RHEL — but for your Kubernetes apps.

With Helm, you can:
 • Install applications with a single command
 • Manage complex deployments as reusable packages
 • Easily upgrade, rollback, and configure your applications

🎁 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘀?
Helm uses charts — preconfigured packages that define a Kubernetes application. A chart includes:
 • All the Kubernetes manifests needed (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.)
 • Templates that make it customizable for different environments
 • A values file to override defaults easily

You can use:
 • Official charts from repositories like Artifact Hub
 • Custom charts for your in-house applications

⚙️ 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗺?
Managing Kubernetes manifests manually can quickly become overwhelming — especially with apps that include multiple services, secrets, and config options.

Helm simplifies this by:
 • Packaging everything together
 • Supporting versioning
 • Enabling repeatable deployments
 • Making upgrades and rollbacks safe and easy

🚀 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀
 • Want to deploy NGINX Ingress or Prometheus? Use Helm charts.
 • Need to deploy the same app in dev, staging, and prod with different configs? Helm makes it a breeze.
 • Need to rollback after a bad release? Helm’s got your back with versioned releases.
