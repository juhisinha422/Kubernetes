Intro to Docker – The Engine Behind Containers 🐳


🛠️ What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that enables you to:
 - Package applications with everything they need (code, libraries, dependencies)
 - Run them consistently across environments
 
 It simplifies building, shipping, and running containers.
📦 Key Concepts: Docker Images vs. Containers
- Docker Image:
  A read-only template with instructions for creating a container (like a blueprint).
  Example: nginx:latest, python:3.11-slim
 
 - Docker Container:
  A running instance of an image. It’s isolated, lightweight, and disposable.
  You can start, stop, restart, and remove containers easily.

⚙️ What is Docker Engine?
It’s the core part of Docker that runs on your machine. It:
 - Builds images
 - Manages containers
 - Handles networking and storage
 
 Once installed, you interact with it using simple CLI commands like `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker build`, etc.

🔥 Real Example
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
This pulls the Nginx image (if not already available), runs it in detached mode (-d), and maps port 80 of the host to the container. Simple and powerful!
