🗓 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭𝟰: 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 – 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁er
By now, we’ve used Services to expose Pods within and outside the cluster. But what if you want to:
 • Host multiple services under one domain?
 • Enable SSL/TLS termination?
 • Configure routing rules like /api → backend, /web → frontend?

This is where Ingress shines. It's like the traffic controller for your cluster's HTTP/S requests.

🌐 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀?
An Ingress is an API object that manages external access to your services, typically over HTTP and HTTPS. It provides routing rules based on hostnames or paths, allowing you to consolidate multiple services behind a single load balancer.

🧩 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀
You define Ingress rules in YAML (host/path → service).
An Ingress Controller (like NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy) reads those rules and configures the underlying routing.
Traffic flows through the controller → to the correct service → to Pods.

🔐 𝗕𝗼𝗻𝘂𝘀: 𝗧𝗟𝗦 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁
Ingress also supports 𝗦𝗦𝗟/𝗧𝗟𝗦 termination, so you can serve secure content by attaching a certificate.

Feature           Description
Traffic Routing      Directs traffic to services by URL or host
TLS Support      Handles HTTPS for services
Consolidation      One LoadBalancer for many services
Requires           Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) 

📌 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
Ingress gives you fine-grained control over how traffic flows into your cluster. It's essential for building real-world, internet-facing apps in Kubernetes.
