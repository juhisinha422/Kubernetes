Today, we focus on something most clusters lack by default: 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀 – the key to controlling who can talk to whom inside your Kubernetes cluster.

🌐 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺?
By default, in Kubernetes, all pods can talk to all other pods—across all namespaces—without restriction.
This "open network" might be fine for experimentation, but in production, it's a security nightmare.
Imagine a compromised pod scanning your entire cluster or reaching into sensitive services like databases or internal APIs.
You need Network Policies to block this kind of east-west traffic unless it's explicitly allowed.

🛡️ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀?
Network Policies define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints.
They’re essentially firewall rules for pods, enforced at the IP level (L3) and port level (L4), using labels and selectors.
You can define policies like:
 • Only allow traffic from specific pods or namespaces.
 • Deny all incoming traffic by default.
 • Allow only certain ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
 • Restrict egress to the internet or certain IPs.
But remember: Network Policies require a compatible CNI plugin (like Calico, Cilium, or Antrea) to be effective.

🚦 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸
A NetworkPolicy is applied to a group of pods based on their labels. It can control:
 • Ingress traffic (incoming to a pod)
 • Egress traffic (outgoing from a pod)

Policies are deny-by-default, but only after you define at least one NetworkPolicy for a pod. Until then, all traffic is allowed.
So, once you create a policy for a pod, only the traffic explicitly allowed in that policy is permitted.

🧠 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀
 • Restrict frontend pods to only talk to backend services.
 • Allow only specific namespaces to access a shared database.
 • Prevent pods from making external HTTP calls unless approved.
 • Implement zero-trust networking within the cluster.

⚠️ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗶𝘁𝗳𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀
 • Just creating a NetworkPolicy doesn’t block all traffic. It only affects pods selected by the policy.
 • Make sure your CNI plugin supports NetworkPolicies. Not all do!
 • Don’t forget about egress rules—a lot of attackers exfiltrate data that way.

📌 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆
Network Policies are essential for securing communication inside your cluster. They allow you to enforce least-privilege networking between services and reduce blast radius in case of compromise.

In modern Kubernetes setups, RBAC controls who can access the API, and Network Policies control how pods talk to each other. You need both for a secure and resilient cluster.
