🧩 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟲: 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (𝗖𝗥𝗗𝘀) 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 – 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝘆
Welcome to Day 26 of my 30 Days of Kubernetes series!

Kubernetes is incredibly powerful—but did you know you can extend it with your own custom APIs?

Today, we’re talking about CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) and Operators—tools that let you go beyond built-in objects like Pods and Services to manage any resource in a Kubernetes-native way.

🔧 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝗖𝗥𝗗𝘀?
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) allow you to define your own Kubernetes resource types.

For example, Kubernetes doesn’t have a built-in object for “Database” or “CacheCluster.” With a CRD, you can create:
$ kubectl get databases
$ kubectl describe cacheclusters
CRDs act just like native resources—versioned, namespaced, and supported by RBAC and the Kubernetes API.

🤖 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿?
While a CRD defines the object, an Operator is a controller that watches for changes to that object and takes action.
Think of it as a Kubernetes-native automation tool for managing complex applications.
Operators are built to:
 • Watch custom resources
 • Apply domain-specific logic
 • React to create/update/delete events
 • Maintain the desired state automatically

In other words, Operators turn your custom resources into self-managing services.

PostgreSQL Operator: Automatically deploys, scales, backs up, and restores your PostgreSQL databases.
 • 𝗞𝗮𝗳𝗸𝗮 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿: Manages topics, brokers, and clusters.
 • 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘀 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿: Ensures high availability and failover handling.
 • 𝗖𝗲𝗿𝘁-𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿: Uses CRDs like Certificate and Issuer to automate TLS provisioning.

With Operators, you can turn even complex infrastructure into "Kubernetes-native APIs."

🏗️ 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗥𝗗𝘀 + 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀?
Feature         CRDs + Operators
Declarative APIs Define everything in YAML, like built-in resources
Automation     No more scripts—Operators act on your behalf
Kubernetes Integration Fully supported by RBAC, audit logs, and CLI
Extensibility     Add new behavior without modifying core K8s code

🛠️ 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀
 • 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿 – Official SDK for building Go-based Operators.
 • 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗦𝗗𝗞 – Part of the Operator Framework; supports Go, Helm, and Ansible.
 • 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 – Lightweight framework to build controllers using webhooks.

You can also find pre-built Operators on OperatorHub.io.

✅ 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆
Custom Resource Definitions and Operators allow you to extend Kubernetes to fit your business or platform needs.
From databases to internal tools, you can automate complex workflows using Kubernetes-native APIs.
