What a Service Mesh actually does in Kubernetes (Istio / Linkerd basics)

Kubernetes handles traffic routing.
A Service Mesh handles traffic behavior.

They solve different problems.

What a Service Mesh is:

1. A dedicated infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication.
2. It works by injecting a sidecar proxy next to each Pod.
3. Application code never talks directly to other services.
4. All traffic flows through the sidecar proxy.

How it works internally:

1. A sidecar proxy (Envoy) is injected into the Pod.
2. All inbound and outbound traffic goes through the proxy.
3. The control plane configures these proxies dynamically.
4. Policies are enforced without changing application code.

What problems it solves:

1. mTLS (mutual TLS) between services.
2. Traffic retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking.
3. Fine-grained traffic control (canary, shadowing).
4. Deep observability (latency, errors, request tracing).

Important reality check:

1. Service Mesh adds complexity.
2. Not every cluster needs it.
3. Best suited for large microservice architectures.
4. Overkill for small or simple systems.

In simple words:
Kubernetes moves traffic.
A Service Mesh controls, secures, and observes that traffic.
