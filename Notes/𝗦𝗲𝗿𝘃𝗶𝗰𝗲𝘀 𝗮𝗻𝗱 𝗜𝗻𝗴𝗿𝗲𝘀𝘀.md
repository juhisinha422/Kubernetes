A Kubernetes service is a resource you create to make a single, constant point of entry to a group of pods providing the same service. Each service has an IP address and port that never change while the service exists. Clients can open connections to that IP and Port and those connections are then routed to ones on the pod backing the service. This way, clients of service don't need to know the location of individual pods providing the service, allowing those pods to be moved around the cluster at any time.

Types of Services:

• 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗜𝗣:

This is the default service type. It exposes the service on an internal IP address within the cluster, making it accessible only to other pods inside the cluster. 

• 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗣𝗼𝗿𝘁:

This type exposes the service on each node's IP address at a static port. This allows external access to the service via the node's IP and the specified port. 

• 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿:

This type exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. It provides a single, stable IP address that directs traffic to the service. 

• 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗡𝗮𝗺𝗲:

This service type maps the service to an external DNS name, effectively acting as an alias for an external service. It doesn't create a proxy but returns a CNAME record with the specified external name. 

• 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀:

This type doesn't assign a cluster IP address. Instead, it allows clients to directly connect to the individual Pods backing the service.

Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that allows you to expose multiple services under a single IP address. An Ingress resource defines rules that determine how traffic from the external network should be forwarded to the services in your cluster.

With Ingress, you can expose multiple services under a single IP address, and use rules to route traffic to the appropriate service based on the 𝗨𝗥𝗟 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗵 or 𝗵𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲. This allows you to expose multiple services with a single 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿 or 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗣𝗼𝗿𝘁, reducing the cost and complexity of managing multiple load balancers or node ports.
