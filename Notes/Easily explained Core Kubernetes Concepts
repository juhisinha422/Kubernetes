Easily explained Core Kubernetes Concepts

- What the hell Kubernetes is?
Kubernetes is a system that runs and manages containers for you.
Instead of manually starting containers, Kubernetes ensures the right number of containers are always running, restarts failed ones, and scales them when traffic increases.

- Cluster Basics
A Kubernetes cluster is split into two parts:
• Control Plane decides what should happen
• Worker Nodes do the actual work

All commands go through the API Server, making Kubernetes fully declarative and API-driven.

- Pods
A Pod is Kubernetes wrapper around containers.
Containers inside a Pod:
• Share the same network (IP, ports)
• Can share storage volumes
• Pods are temporary by design Kubernetes replaces them instead of fixing them.

- Deployments
Deployments manage Pods so you don’t have to.
If a Pod crashes, the Deployment creates a new one.
During updates, it replaces Pods gradually to avoid downtime.

This makes Deployments ideal for stateless applications like APIs and web apps.

- StatefulSets
StatefulSets are for workloads that need identity and persistence.
Each Pod gets:
• A stable name
• A dedicated volume
• Ordered startup and shutdown

That’s why databases and queues rely on StatefulSets.

- Services
Pods come and go, but Services stay.
A Service provides a stable IP and DNS name and automatically load-balances traffic to healthy Pods behind it.

Without Services, reliable communication in Kubernetes wouldn’t be possible.

- Ingress
Ingress controls how external users access applications.
It routes HTTP/HTTPS traffic based on domain names and paths and often handles TLS certificates.

Ingress lets you expose many services using a single external endpoint.

- ConfigMaps & Secrets
They separate configuration from application code.
ConfigMaps store non-sensitive settings, while Secrets store credentials in encoded form.

This allows the same container image to run safely across multiple environments.

- Namespaces
Namespaces are logical boundaries inside a cluster.
They help teams share a cluster without interfering with each other and are commonly used for environment separation.

RBAC and quotas are usually applied at the namespace level.

- Labels & Selectors
Labels describe resources; selectors group them.
Services, Deployments, monitoring tools, and policies all rely on labels to find the right Pods
