Kubernetes Namespaces & Multi-Tenancy Simplified

🔹 One Kubernetes cluster can serve multiple teams with logical isolation, secure access, and operational efficiency. However, achieving true multi-tenancy requires more than just creating namespaces.

🌟 Why Namespaces Matter
Namespaces allow grouping of pods, services, and roles into logical partitions. Key benefits include:

✅ Environment segregation (Dev/Test/Prod)

✅ Resource isolation per team or application

✅ Quotas, limits, and RBAC enforcement

✅ Cleaner CI/CD workflows

🔐 Multi-Tenancy Models in Kubernetes

Model	Use Case	Enforcement Layer
Soft Multi-Tenancy	Internal teams	Namespaces + NetworkPolicy + RBAC
Hard Multi-Tenancy	Strict isolation	VM-level isolation or separate clusters (e.g. Finance vs Ops)

⚙️ Steps to Build Multi-Tenancy

✅ Namespaces – Define logical partitions

✅ Network Policies – Restrict east-west traffic

✅ RBAC – Control access to specific namespaces

✅ Resource Quotas & Limits – Prevent noisy neighbor issues

✅ OPA/Gatekeeper – Enforce naming conventions and policy limits

✅ Azure AD Integration (AKS) – Enable authentication via corporate identity

💡 Best Practices

Use one namespace per team/app/environment

Automate namespace creation using IaC tools (Terraform, Bicep)

Implement auditing and cost tagging at namespace level

For regulated workloads, prefer dedicated node pools or clusters
