💡 Understanding Kubernetes Controllers vs Operators 🚀

If you're exploring Kubernetes automation, you've probably heard of Controllers and Operators — but what exactly sets them apart?
Let’s break it down 👇

⚙️ Kubernetes Controller
A Controller is the brain behind how Kubernetes manages its resources.
🔁 It’s a control loop:
Continuously monitors resources (e.g., Pods, Deployments)
Ensures the actual state matches the desired state
🛠 Example:
The DeploymentController ensures the number of running pods always matches the spec.

🤖 Kubernetes Operator
An Operator is a powerful extension of the controller concept.
💡 Think of it as:
A DevOps engineer in code that knows how to manage a specific application.
🔍 It combines:
A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to define new types of resources
A Controller to manage the full lifecycle of that custom resource
🧠 Example:
A PostgresOperator can:
Deploy a PostgreSQL cluster
Handle backups & restores
Manage scaling and upgrades
Auto-heal failed nodes
