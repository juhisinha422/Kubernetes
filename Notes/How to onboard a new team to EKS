How to onboard a new team to EKS — the secure way 👇

1️⃣ Give them a space
➡ Create a Namespace just for their workloads

2️⃣ Give them an identity
➡ Create an IAM User (CLI access only)

3️⃣ Give them a keycard
➡ Minimal IAM policy like eks:DescribeCluster 😎

4️⃣ Tell the cluster who they are
➡ Map IAM User → Kubernetes Group via aws-auth

5️⃣ Define what they can do
➡ Role + RoleBinding inside only their namespace

6️⃣ Hand them the access badge
➡ aws configure + aws eks update-kubeconfig
---
🎯 Result:
They can deploy freely — but only where they’re supposed to.
🛡️ Security ✔️
🧩 Least privilege ✔️
🚀 Smooth onboarding ✔️
