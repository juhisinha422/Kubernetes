Helm Charts 

Today, I explored Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, and understood how it simplifies managing Kubernetes manifests using charts.
As someone self-learning DevOps and aiming to break into the field, learning Helm gave me confidence in how real-world teams deploy, upgrade, and maintain applications in Kubernetes clusters.

What I Learned:
1. Helm is to Kubernetes what apt or yum is to Linux â€“ a package manager.
2. A Helm Chart is a collection of YAML templates that define a set of   Kubernetes resources.
3. You can use helm install, upgrade, rollback, and delete to manage your app's lifecycle.
4. Charts allow for parameterization, so you can deploy the same app with different configs.
5. Helm helps enforce consistency, versioning, and reuse in Kubernetes environments.
