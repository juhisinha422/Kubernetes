When learning Kubernetes, one thing that helped me a lot was clearly separating who decides and who does the work.

That’s where the Control Plane and Data Plane (Worker Nodes) come in.

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗲

The control plane is the decision-making layer of Kubernetes.

Its responsibilities:
• Accept requests (from kubectl, users, CI/CD, etc.)
• Decide what should run and where
• Maintain the desired state of the cluster
• Store and manage cluster state

The control plane does not run application containers.
It only manages and coordinates.

It contains components like:
API server, scheduler, controller manager, and ETCD.

Worker nodes are where the actual work happens.

Their responsibilities:
• Run application pods
• Execute containers
• Handle networking and storage for workloads
• Report status back to the control plane

Each worker node has components that listen to the control plane and ensure the desired state is met. One important component here is kubelet, which runs on every node.

In simple words:
