Kubernetes Priority Classes: Making Sure the Right Pods Win

When cluster resources are limited, Kubernetes needs to know which Pods matter most. Priority Classes let you assign importance levels so critical workloads get scheduled first and lower-priority Pods can be preempted when necessary.

This is especially useful for protecting system components, production services, and mission-critical jobs during resource pressure.

Not all Pods are equal. Priority Classes help Kubernetes act accordingly.
