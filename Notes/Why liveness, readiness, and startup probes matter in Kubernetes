Why liveness, readiness, and startup probes matter in Kubernetes

Kubernetes needs a way to understand the internal health of your application.
That’s why probes exist — each serving a different purpose.

Liveness Probe
• Checks if the container is alive.
• If it fails → Kubernetes restarts the container.
• Prevents apps from getting stuck in bad states.

Readiness Probe
• Checks if the container is ready to receive traffic.
• If it fails → Pod is removed from Service endpoints.
• Prevents broken apps from receiving requests.

Startup Probe
• Ensures slow-starting apps get enough time to boot.
• Kubernetes won’t run liveness/readiness until startup succeeds.
• Prevents premature restarts.

Why these probes matter:
• Reduced downtime
• More reliable rollouts
• Accurate traffic routing
• Faster failure detection

In simple words:
Probes tell Kubernetes when to start, stop, restart, or route traffic to your Pods.
