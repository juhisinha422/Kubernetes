Monitoring with Grafana

Today I explored Grafana, an open-source platform used for monitoring, observability, and data visualization – and it truly lives up to the hype!
Whether you're tracking server health, application performance, or business metrics, Grafana makes it easy to create powerful, real-time dashboards by connecting to data sources like Prometheus, MySQL, InfluxDB, and more.

What I Learned:

1) Dashboards & Panels
 Visualize time-series data using graphs, gauges, tables, heatmaps, and more.

2) Data Sources
 Grafana doesn’t store data – it connects to external sources like:
a) Prometheus (metrics)
b) Loki (logs)
c) MySQL/PostgreSQL (SQL queries)
d) CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, etc.

3) Alerts & Notifications
 Set up thresholds and get notified via Slack, Email, or Webhooks when something goes wrong.

4) User Management
 Supports role-based access, SSO, and sharing dashboards across teams.
