Kubernetes is the backbone of modern container orchestration! Here's a clear breakdown of its architecture and how it works:

𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀
𝟭. 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿
Acts as the gateway for all client/operator requests.
𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: When a client requests to create a pod, the API Server processes it.

𝟮. 𝗲𝘁𝗰𝗱
The key-value database storing the entire cluster’s state: nodes, pods, deployments, etc.

𝟯. 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲𝗿
Decides where a pod should run (which worker node).
𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀:
Number of pods per node (e.g., if worker-1 has 5 pods and worker-2 has 3, pod goes to worker-2).
Resource requirements (CPU, RAM) — pods needing 2CPU & 4GB RAM won't be scheduled on a node with only 1CPU & 2GB RAM.
User preferences for pod placement.

𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿
Manages controllers that keep the cluster healthy:
Replication Controller: Ensures desired number of pods run continuously.
Node Controller: Monitors node health and replaces failed nodes.
Service Controller: Ensures services are running as expected.

Monitors cluster health via API Server and acts if pods/nodes/services fail.

𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲𝘀: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘀𝗲𝘀
𝟭. 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘁
Communicates node status to the API server. Keeps track of pods (running, pending).

𝟮. 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲-𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘅𝘆
Maintains network rules, IP addresses, DNS, and enables communication between nodes.

𝟯. 𝗣𝗼𝗱𝘀
The smallest deployable units — a set of one or more containers.

𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿: 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀
𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀:

𝟭. 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱 (𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿)
MiniKube (single node, mainly for learning)
Kubeadm, K3D, KOPS (multi-node clusters)

𝟮. 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱 (𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁)
AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
GCP GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)

𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀
Pods contain one or more containers running together.
etcd is the cluster’s database storing all configurations and state in a key-value format.
Scheduler relies on kubelets to get real-time node status before placing pods.
Controllers act based on signals received through the API server to maintain cluster health.

Kubernetes truly automates complex container orchestration with these components working in harmony!
