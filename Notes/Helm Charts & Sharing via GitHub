Helm Charts & Sharing via GitHub 🚢📦🧑‍💻

Welcome to Day 11 of our Kubernetes journey! As your workloads grow in complexity, managing Kubernetes manifests can quickly become overwhelming. That's where Helm — the package manager for Kubernetes — steps in. Today, we'll explore what Helm Charts are and how you can share them with the world using GitHub.

🚢 What is Helm?

Helm is a tool that helps you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications using a format called charts. Think of it like apt or yum — but for Kubernetes.

Helm helps you:

Package Kubernetes YAML into reusable charts

Simplify deployment with templated configurations

Manage versions and rollbacks

Share your apps easily via Helm repositories

📦 What is a Helm Chart?

A Helm Chart is a collection of files that describe a Kubernetes application. At minimum, it includes:

Chart.yaml → Metadata (name, version, etc.)

values.yaml → Default config values

templates/ → Kubernetes resource templates (Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.)


When you run helm install, Helm combines the templates with values and deploys the resulting YAML to your cluster.

💡 Why Use Helm Charts?

Reuse and share common app configurations

Customize deployments using values

Avoid repetition in large-scale clusters

Simplify CI/CD pipelines

Manage versions and rollbacks


> 🔁 Helm makes it easy to update applications with helm upgrade and revert them with helm rollback.

🧑‍💻 Sharing Helm Charts via GitHub

One of the best ways to collaborate and distribute your charts is by hosting them on GitHub. Here’s how you can do that:

Step 1: Structure Your Chart

Create your chart with:

helm create mychart

This gives you a template structure. Customize the templates/ and values.yaml as needed.

Step 2: Push to GitHub

Initialize a Git repository and push your chart code:

git init 
git remote add origin https://lnkd.in/gRVG7wiY 
git push -u origin main

Step 3: Share Your Chart

Others can clone your repo and install the chart locally:

helm install myapp ./mychart

Or you can host a chart repository using GitHub Pages and helm package + helm repo index.

> ✅ Bonus Tip: Automate chart versioning and publishing with GitHub Actions!
