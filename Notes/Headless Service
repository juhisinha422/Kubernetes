ðŸš€ Kubernetes Tip : Headless Services! ðŸ§ 

In Kubernetes, a Headless Service is special kind of service without a clusterIp

this helps in statefulset application to assign stable DNS names for each pod.

direct pod access no load balancing.

A Headless Service is created by setting clusterIP: None. Instead of routing traffic to a single ClusterIP, it returns the IP addresses of the backing pods directly (via DNS).

 Useful when:
1. StatefulSets (like Cassandra, Kafka, Elasticsearch)
2.Peer-to-peer communication


Note : if you set ClusterIp: None than only considered as headless service.
