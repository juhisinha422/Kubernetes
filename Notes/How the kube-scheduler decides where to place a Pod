How the kube-scheduler decides where to place a Pod

The kube-scheduler’s job is simple to describe but extremely smart in execution:
Pick the best node for every new Pod.
Here’s how it actually works:
🔸 First, it filters out nodes that cannot run the Pod (insufficient CPU/memory, taints, node conditions).
🔸 Then, from the remaining nodes, it scores each one based on factors like:
   ▪️  resource availability
   ▪️  spreading pods across zones/nodes
   ▪️  affinity/anti-affinity rules
   ▪️  existing workloads
   ▪️  custom scheduling policies
🔸 The node with the highest score wins.
🔸 The scheduler then sends a binding decision to the API server.

Important point:
The scheduler never starts containers — it only decides where they should run.
The kubelet on the chosen node handles the actual creation of Pods.

In simple words:
The scheduler filters → scores → picks the best node — and that’s how every Pod finds its home.
