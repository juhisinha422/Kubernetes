How etcd stores and replicates cluster state (Raft basics)

etcd is the only place where Kubernetes stores its entire cluster state — Pods, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Nodes, everything.

Here’s how it keeps that state consistent and safe:

🔸 etcd uses the Raft consensus algorithm to agree on every write.
🔸 A cluster has one leader and multiple followers.
🔸 All writes (from the API server) go to the leader only.
🔸 The leader replicates the data to followers and waits for a majority (quorum) to acknowledge.

Once a majority agrees, the data is committed and becomes the official state.
Followers can serve reads, but writes always go through the leader.
Why this matters:

🔸 Even if some nodes fail, etcd stays consistent as long as the quorum is alive.
🔸 It prevents split-brain and corrupted cluster state.
🔸 Kubernetes reliability depends entirely on etcd’s correctness.

In simple words:
etcd uses Raft to make sure every piece of Kubernetes state is safely stored and agreed upon by most nodes before it becomes “real.”
