Kubelet: The Quiet Worker Behind Every Kubernetes Node

Kubelet is the agent installed on every Kubernetes node, responsible for keeping Pods healthy and running exactly as the control plane expects.

What Kubelet actually does:
- Watches the API server for Pod assignments
- Ensures containers are created, started, and running
- Reports node & pod status back to the control plane
- Handles probes, logging, and container lifecycle events
- Syncs desired state vs. actual state continuously

It’s the “node brain” of Kubernetes.
If Kubelet stops, your Pods stop too.
Understanding Kubelet helps you troubleshoot issues faster.
