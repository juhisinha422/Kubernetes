Why Use Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that helps you deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications efficiently.

* Key Benefits:
- Automatic Deployment & Scaling â€“ Containers start, stop, or scale based on demand.
- Self-Healing â€“ Fails containers are automatically restarted.
- Load Balancing & Service Discovery â€“ Routes traffic to the right containers automatically.
- Easy Updates & Rollbacks â€“ Update apps without downtime and roll back if needed.
- Efficient Resource Use â€“ Optimizes CPU and memory across servers.

ðŸ’¡ Bottom Line:
 If youâ€™re running many containers across multiple servers, Kubernetes keeps everything organized, reliable, and scalable â€” like a traffic controller for your apps.
