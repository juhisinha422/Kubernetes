How Kubernetes VPA actually works?

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) uses real CPU and memory usage data to recommend better resource requests.

What happens behind the scenes:
➜ Live traffic hits Pods
➜ Metrics Server collects CPU and memory usage
➜ VPA Recommender analyzes usage over time
➜ It calculates recommended resource requests

Then it depends on the mode 👇
Auto mode:
➜ VPA updates CPU/memory requests
➜ Pods are evicted and restarted
➜ New Pods start with optimized requests

Recommendation-only mode:
➜VPA does not change anything
➜ Recommendations are shown in VPA status

VPA provides:
➜ target
➜ lower bound
➜ upper bound
This helps avoid over- and under-provisioning.

Simple mechanism.
Very powerful when used correctly.
