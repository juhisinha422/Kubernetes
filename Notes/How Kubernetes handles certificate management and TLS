How Kubernetes handles certificate management and TLS

Security in Kubernetes heavily depends on certificates.
Almost every component communicates using TLS.

Here’s how Kubernetes manages certificates internally:

1. Control plane certificates
  a. API server uses TLS for all incoming requests.
  b. Scheduler, controller-manager, and kubelets authenticate using certs.
  c. Certificates are issued during cluster bootstrap.

2. Node (kubelet) certificates
  a. Each node has its own client certificate.
  b. Used to authenticate with the API server.
  c. Certificates are rotated automatically in most managed clusters.

3. ServiceAccount certificates
  a. Pods use ServiceAccount tokens to authenticate.
  b. Tokens are projected and rotated automatically.
  c. Used by applications and controllers.

4. TLS for applications
  a. Ingress controllers terminate TLS.
  b. Service Mesh can provide mTLS between Pods.
  c. cert-manager automates certificate issuance and renewal.

How rotation works:

1. Kubernetes monitors certificate expiry.
2. New certificates are generated before expiration.
3. Components reload certificates without downtime.
4. Expired certificates are rejected automatically.

Common mistakes:

1. Disabling certificate rotation.
2. Using long-lived static certificates.
3. Sharing certificates across environments.
4. Ignoring certificate expiry alerts.

In simple words:
Certificates are the trust foundation of Kubernetes.
If certificates fail, the cluster stops trusting itself.
