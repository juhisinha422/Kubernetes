Pair this with the banner above illustrating the leap from YAML chaos to Helm order—

here are my Top 10 Helm Commands every DevOps engineer should master:

1. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘰 𝘢𝘥𝘥 <𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦> <𝘶𝘳𝘭>

Add a chart repository.

Tip: Use consistent naming (e.g. stable, incubator) to avoid confusion.

2. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘰 𝘶𝘱𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦

Fetch the latest charts from all repos.

Tip: Run before every install or search to ensure you’ve got the newest versions.

3. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩 𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘰 <𝘬𝘦𝘺𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥>

Search your added repos for charts.

Tip: Combine with --version to pinpoint a specific chart release.

4. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘭 <𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦> <𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘵>

Deploy a chart as a new release.

Tip: Use --namespace and --create-namespace for isolated environments.

5. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘶𝘱𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘥𝘦 <𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦> <𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘵>

Apply chart updates to an existing release.

Tip: Dry-run with --dry-run --debug to preview changes safely.

6. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘳𝘰𝘭𝘭𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 <𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦> [𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯]

Roll back to a previous release version.

Tip: Check history (helm history) first to choose the right revision.

7. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘵 [--𝘢𝘭𝘭-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘦𝘴]

List all your releases.

Tip: Add --pending or --failed to filter by status.

8. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘴 <𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦>

Show the status and notes of a release.

Tip: Quickly verify that your pods, services, and ingress are healthy.

9. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦𝘴 <𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦> [--𝘢𝘭𝘭]

Inspect the values used for your deployment.

Tip: Add --revision N to compare differences across revisions.

10. 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘮 𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘭 <𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦>

Remove a release and its resources.

Tip: Follow up with kubectl get pvc to clean up any orphaned volumes.
