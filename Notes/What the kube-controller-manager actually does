What the kube-controller-manager actually does

The kube-controller-manager is the engine that keeps Kubernetes running the way you expect.
Its job: continuously watch the cluster and fix anything that drifts from the desired state.

How it works:
	•	It reads the desired state from the API server (e.g., “there should be 5 replicas”).
	•	It checks the actual state reported by nodes and kubelets.
	•	If something doesn’t match, it takes action to correct it:
	•	creates new Pods
	•	removes excess Pods
	•	replaces failed nodes
	•	updates ReplicaSets
	•	manages endpoints, service accounts, jobs, etc.

Kubernetes has many controllers inside it (replication, node, job, deployment…), and this component runs all of them in a loop.

Key idea:
Controllers don’t wait for instructions — they constantly observe the cluster and fix deviations automatically.

In simple words:
kube-controller-manager is the “autopilot” of Kubernetes, always making sure the cluster matches the desired state.
