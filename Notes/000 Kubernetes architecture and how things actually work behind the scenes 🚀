Kubernetes architecture and how things actually work behind the scenes 🚀

At a high level, Kubernetes is divided into Control Plane and Data Plane (Worker Nodes).

🔹 Pod
The smallest unit in Kubernetes — a pod can contain one or more containers that run together.

🧠 Control Plane (Master Node)
API Server – Entry point of Kubernetes; handles all requests and exposes the cluster

etcd – Key-value store that holds the cluster state

Scheduler – Decides where pods should run based on resources

Controller Manager – Ensures desired state (replicas, nodes, etc.) is maintained

Cloud Controller Manager – Integrates Kubernetes with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

⚙️ Data Plane (Worker Node)
kubelet – Creates and monitors pods on the node

kube-proxy – Handles networking and service load balancing

Container Runtime – Runs containers inside pods (Docker, containerd, etc.)

Slowly building a strong Kubernetes foundation 💪
