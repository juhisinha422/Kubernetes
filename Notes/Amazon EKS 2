Amazon EKS – Use Cases, Types, and Best Practices

As a DevOps engineer, I’ve seen how Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) has become a go-to solution for running containerized workloads at scale. It provides the flexibility of Kubernetes with the reliability of AWS. But to use it effectively, it’s important to know when and how to use different EKS types, along with best practices for configuration, security, and monitoring.

⸻

🔎 Use Cases of EKS
 • 🏢 Enterprise Applications – Deploy microservices with auto-scaling and high availability.
 • 📊 Data & Analytics – Run Spark or ML pipelines natively on Kubernetes.
 • 🤖 MLOps & AI – Host ML models with Kubeflow, KServe, or Seldon on EKS.
 • 🌐 Web Applications & APIs – Power backend services with high traffic.
 • 🛠️ CI/CD Workloads – Run build agents and GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux) in Kubernetes.

⚡ Types of EKS Clusters

1️⃣ EKS on EC2 – Full control over worker nodes.
 • ✅ Best when you need custom AMIs, GPUs, or fine-grained control.
 • ⚡ Use Case: AI/ML workloads, GPU-accelerated apps.

2️⃣ EKS on Fargate – Serverless Kubernetes pods.
 • ✅ Best for small workloads without managing nodes.
 • ⚡ Use Case: Lightweight APIs, event-driven apps.

3️⃣ EKS Anywhere – Deploy EKS clusters on-premises.
 • ✅ Best for hybrid cloud or regulatory environments.
 • ⚡ Use Case: Finance, healthcare, data-sensitive industries.

🛠️ Best Practices for Configuring Applications on EKS
 • Use Helm charts or Kustomize for consistent deployments.
 • Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for scaling workloads.
 • Keep workloads isolated using namespaces.
 • Use ConfigMaps & Secrets for configuration management.

⸻

🔐 Security Best Practices
 • Integrate IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) – avoid hardcoding AWS credentials.
 • Apply Pod Security Policies / OPA Gatekeeper for restricting privileges.
 • Enable network policies to control pod-to-pod communication.
 • Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities (ECR scanning, Trivy).

⸻

📊 Monitoring & Observability
 • Use CloudWatch Container Insights for logs and metrics.
 • Integrate Prometheus + Grafana for custom monitoring dashboards.
 • Implement Alertmanager for proactive alerts.
 • Use AWS X-Ray or Jaeger for distributed tracing.

⸻

💡 Takeaway:
EKS is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Use EC2-based EKS for control and performance, Fargate for simplicity, and EKS Anywhere for hybrid needs. Combine it with strong security practices and monitoring to ensure your cluster is production-ready, scalable, and secure.
