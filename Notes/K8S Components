Here’s a breakdown of the core components every DevOps/SRE engineer must understand:

API Server – The entry point for all control plane interactions
etcd – The cluster’s memory (and your single point of truth)
Scheduler – Assigns pods to the best nodes
Controller Manager – Keeps actual state aligned with desired state
Kubelet – Runs on every node to manage container lifecycles
Kube Proxy – Handles networking across services and pods
CoreDNS – Resolves internal cluster names — quietly, but critically
Container Runtime – Runs the actual containers (e.g., containerd/Docker)
Pods/Nodes – The units of scale, isolation, and execution
