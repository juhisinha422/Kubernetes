When defining memory resources in Kubernetes, it’s crucial to understand the difference between decimal and binary units. A small mistake can lead to over-provisioning or under-provisioning your pods. Let’s clear it up 👇

📏 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 (𝗦𝗜) 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘀
Used in general computing, based on powers of 10:

1K = 1,000 bytes

1M = 1,000,000 bytes

1G = 1,000,000,000 bytes

🧮 𝘽𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙧𝙮 (𝙄𝙀𝘾) 𝙐𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙨
Used in Kubernetes and memory-related contexts, based on powers of 2:

1Ki (Kibibyte) = 1,024 bytes

1Mi (Mebibyte) = 1,048,576 bytes

1Gi (Gibibyte) = 1,073,741,824 bytes

✅ 𝘽𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙋𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙚
Always use Mi or Gi when setting memory in Kubernetes to ensure precise resource allocation.
🔹 memory: 512Mi → exactly 512 × 1,048,576 bytes
🔹 memory: 1Gi → exactly 1,073,741,824 bytes

🛡️ Don’t let your pod crash or get over-provisioned just because you used M instead of Mi.
