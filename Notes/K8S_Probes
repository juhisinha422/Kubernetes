Basic Explanation of Kubernetes Probes: -
=========================================== 

Liveness Probe (Are you still alive?)

Imagine you are running a bakery. You regularly check if the baker is still active (not passed out or left the shop). If the baker has fainted, you call for a replacement Similarly, Kubernetes uses a liveness probe to check if a container is still running. If it fails, the container is restarted.

Readiness Probe (Are you ready to work?)

Before opening the bakery doors to customers, you make sure the baker has all the ingredients ready, ovens are preheated, and the shop
is clean. If these aren't done, the bakery remains closed to customers until everything is ready. Kubernetes does the same with a readiness probe-It checks if the container is fully ready to handle traffic and only sends requests once everything is in place.

Startup Probe (Are you ready to start?)

When the baker starts a new recipe, you give extra time for them to prepare the dough and preheat the oven before checking their progress. Kubernetes uses a startup probe for containers that take extra time to initia- lize, ensuring they're given enough time before health checks begin.
