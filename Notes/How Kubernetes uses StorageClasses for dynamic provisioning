How Kubernetes uses StorageClasses for dynamic provisioning

Manually creating storage for every Pod does not scale.
Kubernetes solves this with StorageClasses.

What a StorageClass does:

1. Defines how storage should be created.
2. Specifies:
 a. storage type (EBS, PD, Azure Disk, NFS, etc.)
 b. performance tier
 c. reclaim policy
3. Acts as a template for dynamic volume creation.

How dynamic provisioning works:

1. A Pod requests storage using a PVC.
2. The PVC references a StorageClass.
3. Kubernetes asks the CSI driver to create a volume.
4. A PersistentVolume (PV) is created automatically.
5. The PV is bound to the PVC and mounted into the Pod.

Key StorageClass settings:

1. provisioner
 a. CSI driver responsible for volume creation
2. reclaimPolicy
 a. Delete (default)
 b. Retain
3. volumeBindingMode
 a. Immediate
 b. WaitForFirstConsumer

Why this matters:

1. No manual storage management.
2. Faster application deployments.
3. Consistent storage behavior across environments.
4. Works perfectly with StatefulSets and databases.

In simple words:
StorageClasses tell Kubernetes
How to create storage when your application asks for it.
