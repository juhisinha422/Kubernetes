To access applications running inside Kubernetes Pods, we must expose them using Services. Here's a comprehensive breakdown with practical steps for setting it up on AWS using kOps.👇

🛠️ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲?
✅ Service = A method to expose pods in your cluster
✅ Each pod gets its own IP, but to access from outside, we need a Service

🔍 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀:
1️⃣ 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗜𝗣 (𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗢𝗻𝗹𝘆):
Provides a stable IP inside the cluster
Ideal for internal communication (e.g., databases)
𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀:
➡️ curl <ClusterIP>

2️⃣ 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗣𝗼𝗿𝘁 (𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀):
Exposes service on each Node’s IP at a static port
Port range: 30000 – 32767
𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀:
➡️ http://<Node_Public_IP>:<NodePort>
⚠️ 𝗗𝗿𝗮𝘄𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸: Too many URLs if multiple nodes — not ideal for end-users

3️⃣ 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿 (𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻):
Exposes service externally using Cloud Provider’s Load Balancer
Distributes traffic among nodes
