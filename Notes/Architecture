🚀 Let's take a deep dive into Kubernetes architecture 🚀

🚀 What is Kubernetes (K8s)?
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps you run applications reliably across a cluster of machines, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

🏗️ Kubernetes Architecture Overview

🔹 1. Control Plane – The Brain 🧠
Responsible for managing the cluster and making global decisions.

✔️API Server: Entry point for all commands (kubectl, UI, etc.)
✔️etcd: Stores all cluster data (key-value store)
✔️Controller Manager: Ensures the desired state of the cluster
✔️Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability

🔹 2. Worker Nodes – The Muscle 💪
These run the actual applications in containers.

✔️Kubelet: Communicates with the control plane, manages pods
✔️Kube-proxy: Handles networking and service discovery
✔️Container Runtime: Runs containers (e.g., containerd, Docker)

🔹 3. Pods – The Smallest Deployable Unit 📦
Each pod contains one or more containers that share storage, network, and a specification for how to run them.
