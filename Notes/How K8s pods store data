How Do Kubernetes Pods Store Data Using Persistent Volumes (PV)? 🐳📦

One common question for anyone working with Kubernetes is:

👉 "How do pods store data that survives restarts or failures?"

Here’s a quick breakdown 💡:

📦 Persistent Volumes (PV) to the Rescue
In Kubernetes, pods are ephemeral — if they restart, all data inside is gone. But when you need durable storage, you use:

🔹 Persistent Volume (PV):
A cluster-wide storage resource provisioned by an admin or dynamically via a storage class.

🔹 Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):
A request from a pod for specific storage requirements (size, access mode, etc.).

🔁 How It Works
🧾 Pod defines a PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)

🎯 Kubernetes matches the PVC to an available PV (or provisions one dynamically)

🔗 The PVC is mounted into the pod as a volume

📁 Pod containers can now read/write data, and it's safely stored outside the pod lifecycle


📦 This approach ensures:

✅ Data survives pod restarts
✅ Backups and snapshots
