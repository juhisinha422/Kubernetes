How Kubernetes DNS works (CoreDNS explained simply)

Pods don’t talk to each other using IPs.
They talk using names — and Kubernetes DNS makes that possible.

Here’s how DNS works inside Kubernetes:

1. Kubernetes runs CoreDNS as a system component.
2. CoreDNS watches the API server for:
 a. Services
 b. Endpoints
 c. Pods (optional)
3. For every Service, CoreDNS creates a DNS record.
4. Pods automatically get DNS configuration injected at startup.
5. DNS queries from Pods go to CoreDNS, not the internet.

Common DNS formats:

1. service-name
2. service-name.namespace
3. service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local

Example:
backend.default.svc.cluster.local

What happens behind the scenes:

1. A Pod sends a DNS query.
2. CoreDNS resolves it to the Service ClusterIP.
3. kube-proxy routes traffic to one of the healthy Pods.
4. If Pods change, DNS stays valid.

Why this matters:

1. No hardcoded IPs in applications.
2. Services remain discoverable during scaling.
3. Enables microservice communication.
4. Critical for reliability in dynamic clusters.

In simple words:
CoreDNS turns dynamic Pods into stable, discoverable services
using DNS names instead of IP addresses.
