🚀 Kubernetes Autoscaling: HPA vs VPA – Explained Simply.
One of the biggest strengths of Kubernetes is autoscaling,  But not all auto-scalers do the same job.

1) HPA (Horizontal Pod Auto-scaler)
            HPA scales the number of Pods based on metrics like CPU or memory usage.
What HPA does:
 ✅ Increases/Decreases  Pods when traffic spikes or drops.
 ✅ Keeps applications highly available.
 ✅ Works without restarting Pods.

2) VPA (Vertical Pod Autos-caler)
            VPA scales the resources of a Pod (CPU / memory).
What VPA does:
 ✅ Adjusts CPU & memory requests
 ❌ Often requires Pod restarts
 ❌ Not ideal for live traffic spikes

Best for -> Batch jobs, Background workers & Low-traffic applications.

Why HPA is used in production?
      👉 No Pod restarts during scaling.
      👉 Handles real-time traffic spikes.
      👉 Cost-efficient scaling.
      👉 Works perfectly with Deployments & Services.
That’s why most production systems prefer HPA over VPA.
