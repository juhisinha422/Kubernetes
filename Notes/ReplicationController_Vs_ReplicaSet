🚀 Kubernetes Deep Dive: ReplicationController vs. ReplicaSet
As a DevOps Engineer, diving into Kubernetes internals is part of the daily grind — and today’s focus was understanding the practical differences between ReplicationController (RC) and ReplicaSet (RS) beyond just definitions.

🔍 ReplicationController (RC)

Introduced early in Kubernetes to maintain a fixed number of pod replicas.
Uses equality-based selectors (key = value), which limits flexibility.
Does not support Deployments, so lacks declarative rollout capabilities like updates and rollbacks.
Slowly being phased out in favor of newer controllers.

⚙️ ReplicaSet (RS)

Part of the apps/v1 API group, built to replace RC.
Supports set-based selectors (In, NotIn, etc.), making it more powerful and adaptable.
Fully supports integration with Deployments, providing declarative updates, rollbacks, and progressive delivery (e.g., rolling updates).

Pro Insight:

You typically won’t create ReplicaSets directly — they’re managed for you when using a Deployment, which is the standard in modern Kubernetes. But understanding RS gives you clarity into how rollouts, replica management, and label matching work under the hood.

Takeaway: RC is legacy. RS is the foundation. Deployment is the standard.
But knowing all three helps you debug and design smarter.
