Kubernetes Secrets Explained – Secure Your Cluster Like a Pro! 🚀
Managing sensitive data is critical in any production-grade Kubernetes cluster. 🔒

 That’s where Kubernetes Secrets come into play!

📌 What are Kubernetes Secrets?
 Kubernetes Secrets let you store sensitive information such as:
Passwords
API keys
TLS certificates
SSH keys

Instead of hardcoding credentials into your application, Secrets allow you to separate configuration from code – securely and efficiently.

🔧 How Secrets Work:
Stored in base64-encoded format (⚠️ not encrypted by default).
Stored in etcd – ensure etcd is encrypted and access is restricted!
Can be mounted as volumes, used as environment variables, or accessed via the API.
🛡️ Best Practices:
 ✅ Enable encryption at rest for etcd.
 ✅ Use RBAC to restrict access.
 ✅ Avoid exposing Secrets via kubectl describe pod.
 ✅ Use tools like Sealed Secrets or HashiCorp Vault for added protection.

💡 Bonus Tip:
Combine Secrets with ConfigMaps and Service Accounts to build secure, dynamic, and scalable applications.
