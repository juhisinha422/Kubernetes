Helm packages Kubernetes manifests into Charts - reusable templates that define your app, config, services, secrets, and more.

Think of it as Docker Compose, but for Kubernetes.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐦:

• Reusable templates - Write once, deploy anywhere (dev, staging, prod)

• Simple upgrades and rollbacks - Manage app versions cleanly

• Fewer manual errors - Less raw YAML, fewer mistakes

• Rich ecosystem - Use prebuilt charts for tools like NGINX, Prometheus, Postgres, etc.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐈𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬:

Helm brings repeatability, version control, and structure to your Kubernetes workflows - which becomes essential as your infrastructure grows.
