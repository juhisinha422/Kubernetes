A **Pod** is the **smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes (K8s)**.

In simple words:

> A **Pod** is a wrapper around one or more containers that run together on the same machine (node).

## 🔹 What is inside a Pod?

A Pod contains:

1. **One or more containers** (usually one)
2. **Shared Network**

   * Same IP address
   * Same port space
3. **Shared Storage (Volumes)**

---

## 🔹 Key Features of a Pod

### 1️⃣ Single IP Address

All containers inside a Pod share the same IP.

### 2️⃣ Shared Storage

Containers inside a Pod can share data using volumes.

### 3️⃣ Same Lifecycle

If a Pod dies, Kubernetes creates a new Pod (not restarts the same Pod).

## 🔹 Why Do We Need Pods?

Kubernetes does not deploy containers directly.
It deploys **Pods**, which then run containers.

Example:

* If you deploy a **Node.js app**
* Kubernetes creates a **Pod**
* That Pod runs your Node.js container

---

## 🔹 Single-Container Pod (Most Common)

Most Pods run **only one container**.

Example:

```
Pod
 └── Nginx Container
```

---

## 🔹 Multi-Container Pod (Sidecar Pattern)

Sometimes a Pod has multiple containers:

Example:

```
Pod
 ├── App Container
 └── Logging Container
```

Both:

* Run together
* Share storage
* Share network

---

## 🔹 Important Note (Interview Point)

Pods are **ephemeral (temporary)**.
If a Pod crashes, Kubernetes creates a new Pod with a new IP.

That’s why we use:

* **ReplicaSet**
* **Deployment**
* **StatefulSet**

to manage Pods.

## 🔹 Simple Definition for Interviews

> A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that contains one or more containers sharing network and storage.
