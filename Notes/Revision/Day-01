Kubernetes (K8s) is the brain behind managing containers at scale.
It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications reducing human error and increasing efficiency.

✅ Auto-healing of applications
✅ Easy scaling & load balancing
✅ Zero-downtime deployments
✅ Infrastructure abstraction

🧠 Key Concepts:

Pod: Smallest deployable unit in K8s

Node: Machine (VM or physical) that runs pods.

Cluster: Group of nodes.

Master/Control Plane: Orchestrates the whole system.

kubectl: Your CLI tool to talk to K8s

* Command of the Day:

kubectl version --client

This shows your local kubectl version your entry into Kubernetes!
