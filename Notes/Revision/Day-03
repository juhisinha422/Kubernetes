Kubernetes Journey – Day 3

Real-World Production Perspective in Kubernetes, 

I’m starting to connect the dots between theory and production realities. It’s not just about running kubectl commands—it’s about thinking like a production engineer.

🔹 Namespaces in Production
In real deployments, namespaces are more than just “folders” in Kubernetes—they’re an isolation strategy.
We use them to separate environments (dev, staging, prod) and apply RBAC for controlled access.

🔹 Resource Quotas & Limits
In production, forgetting to set CPU/memory limits can cause a single pod to eat up the cluster’s resources—leading to outages.
Always define requests and limits in manifests.

🔹 Secrets & ConfigMaps
Hardcoding credentials? ❌ Not in production.
Instead, use Secrets for sensitive data and ConfigMaps for environment-specific configs.
Pro tip: Always encrypt secrets at rest and integrate with tools like SealedSecrets or HashiCorp Vault.

💡 Key Takeaway:
Learning Kubernetes isn’t just about knowing what a command does—it’s about knowing why it matters in production.
