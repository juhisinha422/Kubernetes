Kubernetes Journey – Day 4
 
*Understanding Services in Kubernetes-

In Kubernetes, Pods are ephemeral they can be created, destroyed, or replaced at any time. But applications often need a stable network endpoint to communicate. This is where Services come into play.

🔹 What is a Service?
A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction layer that exposes a set of Pods as a single, stable network endpoint. It ensures that even if the underlying Pods change, the communication remains uninterrupted.

🔹 Common Service Types:
1️⃣ ClusterIP – Default type; exposes the service within the cluster.
2️⃣ NodePort – Exposes the service on a static port on each Node’s IP.
3️⃣ LoadBalancer – Integrates with cloud providers to create an external load balancer.
4️⃣ ExternalName – Maps the service to an external DNS name.

🔹 Why Services Matter:
✅ Enables load balancing across Pods.
✅ Decouples applications from Pod IPs.
✅ Supports internal and external communication.

* Tip: Always pair Services with labels & selectors to dynamically discover healthy Pods.
