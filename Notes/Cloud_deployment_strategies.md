Cloud Deployment Strategies – Simplified 

Not all deployments are created equal.

Choosing the right strategy = safer releases + happier users.

Here are 4 common deployment methods every DevOps/SRE should know 👇

🔸 1. Recreate Deployment

 ➡️ Shut down old version, deploy new one

 ✔️ Simple & fast

 ⚠️ Causes downtime

 📌 Best for: Internal apps or non-critical systems

🔹 2. Rolling Deployment

 ➡️ Update one instance at a time

 ✔️ No downtime, gradual release

 📌 Best for: Microservices and distributed systems

🟩 3. Blue-Green Deployment

 ➡️ Keep 2 environments (Blue = live, Green = new)

 ✔️ Instant switch + easy rollback

 📌 Best for: High-availability or mission-critical apps

🟪 4. Canary Deployment

 ➡️ Release new version to a small group first

 ✔️ Test in real-time, catch bugs early

 📌 Best for: Continuous delivery environments
