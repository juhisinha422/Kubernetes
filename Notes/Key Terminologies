➡️ Job
A Job manages batch tasks by ensuring a specified number of Pods complete their execution successfully and then terminate.

➡️ Namespace
Namespaces divide cluster resources among multiple users or teams, creating isolated environments within the same cluster.

➡️ Volume
A Volume provides persistent storage accessible to Pods, outlasting the Pod’s lifecycle, with varying persistence based on type.

➡️ Ingress
Ingress manages external access to services, primarily for HTTP and HTTPS, using routing rules defined for traffic management.

➡️ DaemonSet
A DaemonSet ensures a Pod runs on all (or specific) Nodes, useful for deploying system services like logging or monitoring agents.

➡️ Operator
An Operator automates the deployment and management of complex applications using custom resources to handle lifecycle tasks.

➡️ ClusterRole
A ClusterRole defines permissions for resources at the cluster level, facilitating access control across all namespaces.

➡️ Secret
A Secret stores and manages sensitive data such as passwords or tokens securely, preventing exposure in Pod specifications.

➡️ ReplicaSet
A ReplicaSet maintains a specified number of identical Pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas are always running.

➡️ CronJob
A CronJob schedules and runs Jobs periodically using a cron-like format, automating tasks like backups or data processing.

➡️ Event
An Event captures information about resource state changes and significant occurrences in the cluster for monitoring and debugging.

➡️ ConfigMap
A ConfigMap stores non-confidential configuration data as key-value pairs, allowing Pods to access this data without embedding it in code.

➡️ Deployment
A Deployment manages ReplicaSets and facilitates rolling updates, scaling, and rollbacks of Pods to maintain the desired application state.

➡️ ServiceMonitor
A ServiceMonitor specifies how Prometheus should discover and monitor services, configuring metric scraping and integration with Prometheus.

➡️ Endpoint
An Endpoint maps a Service to the IP addresses and ports of the backing Pods, routing traffic to the appropriate Pods within the cluster.
