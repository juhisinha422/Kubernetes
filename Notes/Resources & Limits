Kubernetes Resource Requests & Limits:
- In a Pod, all containers share the same memory and CPU.
- If one container consumes all the memory, other containers cannot perform their activities.
- If CPU is used, other containers will be slower.
- If memory is used up, other containers may be killed.

Key Concepts:
- Requests: Minimum threshold of CPU or memory guaranteed for the container.
- Limits: Maximum threshold a container can use.
- Limit can be equal to or greater than request, but not smaller.
- If the limit is reached, the container cannot consume more resources.

Example
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: mypod
spec:
 containers:
  - name: app-container
   image: myapp:latest
   resources:
    requests:
     memory: "200Mi"
     cpu: "500m"
    limits:
     memory: "500Mi"
     cpu: "1"
  - name: sidecar-container
   image: mysidecar:latest
   resources:
    requests:
     memory: "100Mi"
     cpu: "200m"
    limits:
     memory: "300Mi"
     cpu: "500m"


ðŸ’¡ Takeaway:
- Properly setting requests and limits ensures that containers in a Pod share resources fairly and prevents one container from affecting others.
