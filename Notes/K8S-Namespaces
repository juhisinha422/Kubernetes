ðŸ”§ Kubernetes Namespaces â€” Keeping Your Cluster Organised ðŸ”§

As Iâ€™ve been learning Kubernetes, one concept that makes managing a cluster much easier is Namespaces.

A Namespace is like a separate space within your cluster that keeps resources organised and isolated. It lets different teams or projects work in the same cluster without interfering with each other.

For example, your development and testing teams can each have their own Namespace, so their apps and resources stay separate and organised.

Itâ€™s a simple but powerful way to keep things tidy in a shared environment.
