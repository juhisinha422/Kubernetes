Kubernetes Logs - Where to Actually Look
A lot of DevOps beginners struggle with Kubernetes debugging because they don’t know which logs live where.

Container Logs: /var/log/containers/*.log
➜ Crashes, exceptions, misconfigurations inside the container.

Pod Logs: /var/log/pods/*.log
➜ Multi-container issues, networking problems, interactions between containers.

Kubelet Logs: /var/log/kubelet.log
➜ Pod lifecycle, scheduling, resource assignment, and node-level communication.

Control Plane Logs
     API Server: /var/log/kube-apiserver.log
     Controller Manager: /var/log/kube-controller-manager.log
     Scheduler: /var/log/kube-scheduler.log
     etcd: depends on deployment
➜ Useful for debugging cluster-level issues, API failures, scheduling problems, or controller loops.

Node Logs: syslog (location depends on OS)
➜ Hardware issues, node pressure, kernel problems.

Application Logs: /var/log/app.log
➜ Logic errors, crashes, slow responses.

Custom Logs: /var/log/custom-app.log
➜ Domain-specific behavior or critical business events.
