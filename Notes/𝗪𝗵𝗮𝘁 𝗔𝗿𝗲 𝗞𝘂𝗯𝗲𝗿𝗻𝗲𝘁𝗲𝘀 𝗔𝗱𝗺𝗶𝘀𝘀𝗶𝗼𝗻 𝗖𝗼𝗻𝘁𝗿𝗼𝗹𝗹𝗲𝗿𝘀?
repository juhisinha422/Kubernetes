After authentication and RBAC…

Every request hits Admission Controllers.

Think of them as Kubernetes’ internal gatekeepers.

They can:

• Reject a request
• Modify a request
• Enforce policies
• Inject defaults
• Apply security constraints

Examples of built-in admission plugins:

 • NamespaceLifecycle

 • LimitRanger

 • ServiceAccount

 • ResourceQuota

 • PodSecurity

They run inside the 𝗸𝘂𝗯𝗲-𝗮𝗽𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿.

Want to check enabled plugins?

If kube-apiserver runs as a pod:

 • kubectl -n kube-system get pod
 • kubectl describe pod kube-apiserver-<node>


Look for --𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲-𝗮𝗱𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗽𝗹𝘂𝗴𝗶𝗻𝘀.

These controllers silently shape your cluster behavior.
