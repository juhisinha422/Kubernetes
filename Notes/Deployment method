Different Deployment Method

1. Blue-Green Deployment
Maintain two environments: Blue (current version) and Green (new version).
Steps:
a) Deploy the new version to the Green environment.
b) Test the Green environment.
c) Switch traffic from Blue to Green (using DNS or a load balancer).
d) If something goes wrong, switch back to Blue.


2. Rolling Deployment
Update your application gradually, one instance at a time.
Steps:
a) Remove one instance of the old version from service.
b) Deploy the new version to that instance.
c) Add it back to the pool.
d) Repeat for all instances.


3. Canary Deployment
Release the new version to a small percentage of users first.
Steps:
a) Deploy to a small group (e.g., 5% of users).
b) Monitor for issues.
c) Gradually increase the rollout to more users.


4. Shadow Deployment
The new version receives real user traffic in the background, but responses are not returned to users.
Steps:
a) Deploy the new version alongside the old one.
b) Mirror real traffic to the new version.
c) Analyze logs and performance without affecting users.


5. Feature Flags (Feature Toggles)
Hide new features behind flags until they are ready.
Steps:
a) Deploy the full codebase with features disabled.
b) Enable features gradually for specific users or environments.
c) Disable instantly if issues arise.
