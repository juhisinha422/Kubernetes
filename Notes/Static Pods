Understanding Static Pods in Kubernes
 
One of the interesting Kubernetes concepts every DevOps engineer should know! 🚀

🧩 What are Static Pods?

Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet on a specific node, not by the Kubernetes control plane (like API server or controller manager).

📍 Key Points:

Created automatically by kubelet using manifest files located in a specific directory 

(/etc/kubernetes/manifests).

They are bound to a particular node — if the kubelet stops, the static pod also goes down.

No ReplicaSet or Deployment manages them.

Commonly used for critical control plane components such as kube-apiserver, etcd, etc.


🧠 Why Important?
They help bootstrap the control plane when a cluster is being initialized and give us deeper insights into how Kubernetes starts working behind the scenes.

💬 My takeaway:
Static Pods remind us that Kubernetes isn’t just about automation — it’s also about understanding the foundation!
