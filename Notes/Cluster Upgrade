Have you heard of Cluster Upgrade❓Is Cluster Upgrade important❓ Why❓

#ClusterUpgrade 💡 

Because k8 only supports 3️⃣  version at a time, so earlier version will not be in support and no bug fixes will be there.

👇 Points that need to be taken care while upgrading 📈 :

🔹 The Upgrade workflow at the high level:
Upgrade Control Plane ➡ Upgrade worker nodes

🔹Kubernetes Version: major.minor.patch == 1.30.2

🔹One cannot directly upgrade from 1.28.2 -> 1.30.2 . It should be done from version to version i.e. 1.28.2➡1.29.3➡1.30.2 

🔹Drain and Uncordon 🚫 :
During Upgrade we ensure that no pod is scheduled on that node so this is done by drain and cordon. 
Drain   => evicting the pods
Cordon=> node is not schedulable ⛔ 

>>> kubectl drain node1 --ignore-daemonsets
(This will do both tasks i.e. drain and cordon the node. When we drain node, the pods on node are evicted except DaemonSets so we need to specify --ignore-daemonsets.) 

🎯Strategies for upgrade:
🔸All at once: Drain -> Upgrade -> Uncordon
🔸Rolling Update: One at a time , minimizing downtime
🔸Blue-Green: First Blue-side is attached to master-node and Green-side is been upgraded and as soon as green-side upgrade is done blue will be detached or maybe deleted as per infrastructure setup.
