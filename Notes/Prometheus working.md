𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐃𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐮𝐬 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤?

𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤 is what separates 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐨𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲.

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞, 𝐧𝐨-𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐟𝐟 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧:

	1.	𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐮𝐬 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 from your apps and services. Unlike some tools that wait for data to be pushed, Prometheus pulls data on its own schedule - keeping you in control.

	2.	It stores everything as 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚. That means every metric is saved over time with 𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐬 - making it easy to 𝐬𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞, 𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐞, and 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐞 trends or anomalies later.

	3.	You query this data with 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐐𝐋. Think of it as a 𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥 that helps you 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐞𝐬 or 𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐭 𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐬 before they become incidents.

	4.	𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭-𝐢𝐧. Set rules for when something crosses a threshold, and Prometheus will send alerts to 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫 -which then pushes notifications to your 𝐢𝐧𝐛𝐨𝐱, 𝐒𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤, or 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐃𝐮𝐭𝐲.

	5.	𝐃𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐬? 𝐍𝐨 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦. Connect Prometheus to 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐚 and build 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 that actually help your team understand what’s happening - 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚.
