How Kubernetes recovers from a full cluster outage (Disaster Recovery)

A full cluster outage is the worst-case scenario.
Kubernetes recovery depends on what failed — and what you backed up.

Types of failures:

1. Control plane failure
2. Worker node failure
3. Complete cluster loss (control plane + nodes)

How Kubernetes recovers:

1. Control plane failure
  a. Restore etcd from the latest snapshot.
  b. Bring up API server, scheduler, and controllers.
  c. Desired state is restored automatically.
  d. Nodes reconnect and workloads resume.

2. Worker node failure
  a. Unhealthy nodes are marked NotReady.
  b. Pods are rescheduled to healthy nodes.
  c. Desired replica count is maintained.

3. Complete cluster loss
  a. Create a new cluster.
  b. Restore etcd snapshot (if available).
  c. Reinstall add-ons and controllers.
  d. Reattach Persistent Volumes if supported.
  e. Applications return to last known desired state.

What backups are REQUIRED:

1. etcd snapshots (mandatory).
2. Persistent volume backups (app data).
3. Git repositories (manifests, Helm charts).
4. Secrets stored securely outside the cluster.

Why GitOps helps here:

1. Cluster config is reproducible.
2. New cluster can be rebuilt quickly.
3. Less manual recovery work.
4. Faster RTO (Recovery Time Objective).

In simple words:
Kubernetes can recover from almost any failure —
but only if you have backups and automation in place.
