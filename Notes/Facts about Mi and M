Did you know that in Kubernetes, 512M and 512Mi are not equivalent, despite both being accepted units? Here's the difference:

- 512M represents 512 × 1,000,000 bytes (Megabytes, base-10).
- On the other hand, 512Mi signifies 512 × 1,048,576 bytes (Mebibytes, base-2).

Kubernetes utilizes base-2 calculations (Mi) for memory operations. Opting for M over Mi can result in:
- Inaccurate resource allocation
- Misleading usage metrics
- Inefficiencies that escalate with scale

For precise memory management, it's advisable to consistently use Mi over M.
