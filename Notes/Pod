Understanding Pods: The Smallest Deployable Units in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, Pods are the foundation of all deployments and the smallest deployable units in the system. Instead of managing individual containers, Kubernetes lets you manage them as a single unit - the Pod.

Some features:
- Shared resources: Containers within a Pod share the same network address (IP address), port space, and storage volumes, enabling efficient communication and coordination between them.

- Ephemeral by Nature: Pods are not designed to be long-lived. They can be created, destroyed, and recreated, ensuring high availability for your workloads.

- Scaling: When scaling your application, Kubernetes simply creates more copies of the Pods, making the process efficient and consistent.

- Isolation: Even though containers within the same Pod share resources, they still maintain isolation at the container level, ensuring security and stability.
