Getting Started with Minikube on Kubernetes 🖥️☸️


---

🔹 What is Minikube?

Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a virtual cluster on your local machine. It's ideal for learning, development, and testing Kubernetes workloads without needing a full-blown cloud setup.


---

✅ Why Use Minikube?

Runs locally on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Fast and simple setup for a Kubernetes cluster.

Supports most Kubernetes features.

---

⚙️ Prerequisites

Before installing Minikube, make sure you have the following:

Docker
kubectl (Kubernetes CLI tool)

Install via:
https://lnkd.in/gsbv6zvj




---

⬇️ Installing Minikube

Windows / macOS / Linux:

Visit the official installation guide:
https://lnkd.in/gbtv3pxU

Or use the terminal (macOS/Linux):

curl -LO https://lnkd.in/gNA74FVf
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube


---

🚀 Starting Your First Cluster

Once installed, start Minikube.

You can specify a driver if needed:

minikube start --driver=docker --force

---

✅ Verifying the Setup

Check the cluster status:

minikube status

Check nodes:

kubectl get nodes

It should show a single node in the Ready state.


---

📦 Deploying Your First Pod

Let’s create a basic deployment:

kubectl run hello-minikube --image=kicbase/echo-server

Check Pods:

kubectl get pods

Describe the deployment:

kubectl describe po hello-minikube

We can also create a manifest file and run it to create pods.

kubetl create -f manifestfile.yml.


---

🧼 Stopping and Deleting the Cluster

Stop the cluster:

minikube stop

Delete it completely:

minikube delete


---
