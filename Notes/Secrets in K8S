🚨 “Secrets in K8s Are Not Secrets”

By default:
K8s secrets are base64-encoded, not encrypted
Anyone with access to the node can read from /var/lib/kubelet

What you should do instead:
1. Use external secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
2. Use SOPS with ArgoCD to encrypt at rest
3. Enable encryption at rest in EncryptionConfiguration
4.  Audit Secret access with kube-apiserver logs
