what is PDB
✅ *PDB in Kubernetes (K8s)*

PDB stands for *Pod Disruption Budget* in Kubernetes. It's a policy that ensures a minimum number of pods are available during voluntary disruptions, such as:

- Node maintenance
- Node upgrades
- Node scaling
- Pod eviction

A PDB defines the maximum number of pods that can be evicted or terminated simultaneously, ensuring that a certain number of pods are always available to serve traffic.

*Key components of a PDB:*

1. *minAvailable*: The minimum number of pods that must be available at all times.
2. *maxUnavailable*: The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable at any given time.
3. *selector*: A label selector that identifies the pods to which the PDB applies.

*Example PDB YAML file:*
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: example-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example

In this example, the PDB ensures that at least 2 pods with the label `app=example` are available at all times.

*Benefits of PDBs:*

1. *Improved availability*: Ensures that a minimum number of pods are always available to serve traffic.
2. *Reduced disruptions*: Minimizes the impact of voluntary disruptions on applications.
3. *Better resource management*: Helps with node maintenance, upgrades, and scaling without affecting application availability.


A  Kubernetes  administrator  can  create  a  deployment  of  a  kind:  PodDisruptionBudgetfor  high  availability  of  the  application,  it  makes  sure  that  the  minimum  number  isrunning  pods  are  respected  as  mentioned  by  the  attribute  minAvailable  spec  file.  Thisis  useful  while  performing  a  drain  where  the  drain  will  halt  until  the  PDB  is  respectedto  ensure  the  High  Availability(HA)  of  the  application.  The  following  spec  file  alsoshows  minAvailable  as  2  which  implies  the  minimum  number  of  an  available  pod(even  aer  the  election).
