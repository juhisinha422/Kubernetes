Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler- explained simply:

1. Sometimes, your pods get stuck in a pending state because thereâ€™s not enough CPU or memory left on any node.

2. The Cluster Autoscaler notices these pending pods and checks all the available node groups to see where more capacity can be added.

3. Once it finds a suitable group, it automatically adds a new node to the cluster.

4. That new node joins the cluster, and Kubernetes schedules the pending pods onto it.

5. Later, when some nodes are barely being used, the autoscaler drains and removes them to save cloud costs.

ðŸ‘‰ If you work in DevOps or Kubernetes clusters, understanding how the Cluster Autoscaler works is the foundation of cost-efficient and reliable scaling.
