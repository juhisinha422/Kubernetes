What is a Kubernetes Operator? 🔁 
A Kubernetes Operator is a custom controller that follows the Kubernetes control loop:
👀 Observe the current cluster state
🧠 Compare it with the desired state
⚙️ Reconcile the difference

It does this continuously.

Operators extend Kubernetes using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and embed application-specific operational knowledge into code.

That means they can automate:
➜ Application-specific scaling logic
➜ Backup & restore workflows
➜ Rolling upgrades
➜ Configuration changes
➜ Failure recovery

Unlike basic Kubernetes controllers (which handle Pods, Deployments, etc.), Operators manage complex, stateful systems like databases or distributed applications.
