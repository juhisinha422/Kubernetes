Kubernetes has become the go-to solution for container orchestration, but its architecture can seem daunting at first glance. Here’s a quick breakdown to simplify it:

🔹 Master Node (Control Plane)
This is where all decisions are made. It includes:
	•	API Server: The entry point for all requests to the cluster.
	•	etcd: A key-value store that acts as the cluster’s “memory.”
	•	Scheduler: Decides which node a pod should run on based on resource requirements and constraints.
	•	Controller Manager: Ensures the cluster stays in its desired state by monitoring and acting when necessary.

🔹 Worker Nodes
These are the machines that do the actual work of running your applications. Each node has:
	•	Kubelet: Ensures containers are running as per the instructions from the master.
	•	Kube-Proxy: Manages networking and allows communication between different components.

🔹 Pods
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. Each pod can contain one or more containers running together.

🔹 Types of Clusters
	•	Self-Managed: You handle the setup and maintenance (e.g., with Kubeadm or MiniKube).
	•	Cloud-Managed: Providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP offer managed solutions so you can focus on your applications.

In a nutshell, Kubernetes is designed to make deploying, scaling, and managing containers as seamless as possible. Its architecture might seem complex initially, but once you understand the flow, it all clicks.
