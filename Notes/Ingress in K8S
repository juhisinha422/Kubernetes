Kubernetes Ingress: Managing External Traffic the Smart Way!

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is a resource that controls how external users access your services inside the cluster. Instead of exposing each service with a NodePort or LoadBalancer, Ingress acts as a single entry point and routes traffic based on rules.

Why Use Ingress?
- Centralized traffic management
- Path or host-based routing (e.g., /api → backend, / → frontend)
- SSL/TLS termination for secure connections
- Reduces the need for multiple load balancers

Example Use Case: Route web traffic to different services (frontend, backend, API) through one domain..
