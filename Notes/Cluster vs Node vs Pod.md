Kubernetes Very basics:

"Cluster vs Node vs Pod"

Think of Kubernetes as a city

🏙️ Cluster = The City

The cluster is the complete ecosystem — managing and coordinating everything within it.

🏢 Node = The Building

Each node is like a building that provides compute resources and infrastructure for workloads.

🏘️ Pod = The Apartment

A pod is like an apartment inside the building — the smallest deployable unit where your containers actually live and run.
