Helm Charts – Package Manager for Kubernetes:
Managing Kubernetes YAML files manually can quickly become painful especially when you have Deployments, Services, Ingress, HPA, ConfigMaps etc that’s where Helm comes into picture.
🟦 What is Helm?
Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. It helps you to package Kubernetes resources, reuse configurations, deploy applications easily and manage versions & upgrades.

🟩 What is a Helm Chart?
A Helm Chart is a collection of Kubernetes YAML templates. It contains:
1) deployment.yaml 
2) service.yml
3) ingress.yml
4) values.yml
That all bundled together.

 Why Helm is used in production:
❌ Copy-pasting YAML across environments
❌ Maintaining separate YAML files for dev / stage / prod
✅ One chart → multiple environments
✅ Values file controls behavior
✅ Easy upgrades & rollbacks

🧾 Simple Helm Flow:
                       Helm Chart + values.yaml
                                           ↓
                          helm install / upgrade
                                           ↓
                    Kubernetes Resources created
🧠 Simple rule to remember:
👉 YAML = raw Kubernetes config
👉 Helm = reusable, configurable, versioned deployments
