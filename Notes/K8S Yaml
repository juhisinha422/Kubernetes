In Kubernetes, YAML files tell the cluster what you want.

Every YAML mainly has 3 parts:

1. Metadata (identity): This tells who the resource is.
➜ name
➜ namespace
➜ labels (used to group and select resources)

2. Spec (desired state): This tells what you want Kubernetes to do.
➜  how many pods
➜ which image
➜ ports, env vars, volumes

3. Status (actual state): This is written by Kubernetes, not you.
➜ Is the pod running or failed?
➜How many replicas are ready?

The magic part 🔄 (control loop)
➜ You apply YAML
➜ Kubernetes stores it in etcd
➜ Controllers compare spec vs status
➜If something breaks, Kubernetes fixes it automatically
