How Kubernetes handles ConfigMaps and Secrets internally

Applications need configuration — but hardcoding values inside images is a bad idea.
Kubernetes solves this using ConfigMaps and Secrets.

How ConfigMaps work:

1. ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration data.
2. Data can be injected into Pods as:
 a. environment variables
 b. command-line arguments
 c. mounted files
3. kubelet fetches ConfigMap data from the API server.
4. Containers read the data at runtime.

How Secrets work:

1. Secrets store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys).
2. They are stored base64-encoded in etcd.
3. Access is controlled using RBAC and service accounts.
4. Secrets can also be injected as:
 a. environment variables
 b. mounted volumes (recommended)

Important differences:

1. ConfigMaps are for configuration.
2. Secrets are for credentials.
3. Secrets have stricter access controls.
4. Secrets should never be stored in Git or images.

Why this matters:

1. Clean separation of code and config.
2. Easy updates without rebuilding images.
3. Better security posture.
4. Safer multi-environment deployments.

In simple words:
ConfigMaps and Secrets let Kubernetes inject configuration
into Pods safely and dynamically without touching the container image.
