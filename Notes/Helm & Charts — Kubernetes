Helm & Charts — Kubernetes Made Simple
================================ 

Kubernetes --> remember these two lines:

👉 Helm = The Package Manager for Kubernetes
 Just like apt, yum, or Homebrew — Helm helps you install, upgrade, and manage applications on K8s with a single command.

👉 Helm Chart = Templatized Kubernetes Manifest Files
 Charts let you reuse, parameterize, and version your Kubernetes YAML instead of copying the same configs everywhere.
