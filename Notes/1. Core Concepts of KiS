ðŸ”‘ Core Kubernetes Concepts to Master

1. Cluster Architecture

Master: Control Plane vs. Worker Nodes

Understand: kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, etcd, kubelet, kube-proxy, and Container Runtime.


2. Pods & Deployments

Learn how to define Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments.

Know: Rolling updates, rollback, and strategies for zero-downtime deployment.


3. Services & Networking

ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and Ingress Controllers (NGINX, Traefik).

Understand: DNS, service discovery, network policies, CNI plugins (Calico, Flannel).


4. ConfigMaps & Secrets

Manage environment configs securely.

Real-world use cases: app-level configuration, DB credentials, API keys.


5. Volumes & Persistent Storage

Understand PV, PVC, StorageClass.

Work with dynamic provisioning (e.g., using EBS on AWS or GCE PD on GCP).


6. Namespaces & RBAC

Multi-tenancy via namespaces.

Fine-grained access control using Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, and ClusterRoleBinding.


7. Helm

Use Helm to package and deploy applications.

Write custom Helm charts for better understanding. 



ðŸŽ¯ Production-Ready & Market-Driven Skills

8. Monitoring & Logging

Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and alerting.

Integrate ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK (Fluentd) for logging.


9. CI/CD Integration

Implement GitOps using ArgoCD or Flux.

Integrate Kubernetes with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI for seamless pipelines.


10. Security Best Practices

Use PodSecurityStandards, SecurityContext, and Network Policies.

Scan images with tools like Trivy, enforce policies via OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno.


11. Autoscaling

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA), Cluster Autoscaler.


12. High Availability & Resilience

Multi-zone clusters, etcd backups, graceful shutdowns, liveness/readiness probes.


13. Service Mesh (Advanced but Valuable)

Intro to Istio, Linkerd, Consul for traffic management, observability, mTLS.



ðŸ§° Tools & Ecosystem Knowledge

kubectl (power user level): aliases, plugins, jsonpath, custom columns.

Lens IDE, K9s, Octant: GUI and TUI tools to improve observability.

Understand cloud-managed Kubernetes: EKS, AKS, GKE.

Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Pulumi.



ðŸ“ˆ Focus Areas to Align with Job Market

1. Project Experience â€“ Deploy sample apps, microservices, or open-source projects.


2. Certifications â€“ Aim for CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) or CKAD.


3. Cloud Integration â€“ Learn how Kubernetes is deployed and managed on AWS/GCP/Azure.


4. Troubleshooting â€“ Practice debugging Pods, networking, crash loops, and logs.


5. Security & Compliance â€“ Market increasingly demands this in DevSecOps environments.



âœ… Learning Strategy

Practice on Minikube, Kind, or Play with Kubernetes

Use real-world projects: deploy WordPress, MongoDB, Node.js apps, etc.

Contribute to GitHub repos or blogs.
