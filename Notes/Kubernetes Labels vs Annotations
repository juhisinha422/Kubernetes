Kubernetes Labels vs Annotations – Know the Difference

- In Kubernetes, metadata helps organize and manage resources. Two common types are Labels and Annotations.

#Labels
- Purpose: Connect and group internal services within the cluster.
- Usage: Used for selectors by controllers, Services, and kubectl.

Example
metadata:
  labels:
    app: backend
    environment: prod

Filter resources using labels:
kubectl get pods -l app=backend

#Annotations
- Purpose: Store extra metadata, including special characters, and can connect to external resources or tools.
- Usage: Not used for selection; mainly for informational, operational, or integration purposes.

Example
metadata:
  annotations:
    description: "Backend pod for API service"
    monitoring-url: "https://lnkd.in/gjtgVJ9P"

✅ Key Difference
- Labels: For internal connections and selection inside the cluster.
- Annotations: For external integrations, extra info, and human-readable metadata.
