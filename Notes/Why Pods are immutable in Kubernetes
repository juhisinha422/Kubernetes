Why Pods are immutable in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, a Pod is treated as a fixed, never-updated unit.
If anything inside a Pod needs to change — Kubernetes doesn’t modify it.
It replaces it.

Here’s why Pods are immutable:

• Changing a running container breaks consistency across nodes.
• Immutable Pods ensure predictable rollouts and rollbacks.
• Controllers (like Deployments) can easily recreate new Pods with updated specs.
• It avoids hidden state issues inside long-running containers.
• Reliability increases because every update becomes a clean, fresh start.

What happens during a change?

• You update the Deployment/StatefulSet spec.
• A new ReplicaSet is created.
• Old Pods are terminated and new Pods with new specs are created.

In simple words:
Pods are not updated — they’re replaced.
This guarantees consistency, stability, and clean deployments.
