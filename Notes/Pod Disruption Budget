In Kubernetes, PDB stands for Pod Disruption Budget. It’s a policy that helps ensure your application maintains availability during voluntary disruptions, such as:

- Node maintenance or upgrades
- Cluster autoscaling
- Draining nodes

🛡️ What Does a PDB Do?

A Pod Disruption Budget sets limits on how many pods from a deployment, replica set, or stateful set can be unavailable at any given time. This prevents too many pods from being taken down simultaneously, which could impact your app’s performance or availability.
