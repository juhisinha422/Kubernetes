Are you authorized to perform tasks on K8's❓Determine your access level🎚.

#Authorization 🧐 : What can you do❓ 

Authorization is like granting access🚪levels within the fortress 🏰 . It determines whether you have the necessary permissions to access specific resources.

Kubernetes offers several authorization modes to manage access to cluster resources.

1️⃣  Node Authorization
This mode grants right to kubelets on nodes to communicate📲 with the API server. It authorize API requests made by kubelet. It is not intended for user authorization.

2️⃣  ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
ABAC mode defines an access control paradigm ⚰whereby access rights are granted to users through the use of policies 📜 which combine attributes together. These policies consist of rules 📄 that match attributes in a user’s request with attributes in the policy.
However, managing and updating ABAC policies can become complex 🤯  with increase in number of policies and attributes.

3️⃣  RBAC (Role-based Access Control) 
RBAC defines policies for users🧑, groups 👨👨👦👦 and processes by allowing or disallowing accesses to manage API resources. It allows cluster administrators 👨💻 to create roles and bind them to users, groups, or service accounts.
🔸 ex: Create roles (like "dev") and assign developer or developer groups to those roles i.e. role binding.
RBAC is widely adopted authorization mode and its the most recommended ✌way of authorization in K8's.

4️⃣  Webhooks
It leverage external tools for more complex 🤔 authorization logic. When a user or process sends a request to the Kubernetes API server, the server sends a webhook authorization request to the external authorizer. 
The authorizer evaluates the request against the defined policies📜and sends a callback📞 response indicating whether the request is authorized ✔ or not ✖ .

5️⃣  AlwaysAllow  ✅ 
This mode allow all requests without any authorization checks. This is the default authorization mode.

6️⃣  AlwaysDeny ❌ 
This mode deny all requests without any authorization checks. 

◾Configure Authorization Modes ✍ :
1. Navigate to /etc/Kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
2. Edit the file, add the desired authorization mode to the "--authorization-mode" flag ⛳ , separating multiple modes with commas.

🔸 ex: --authorization-mode=RBAC,ABAC
