How Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) actually works in Kubernetes

HPA automatically scales your Pods based on real-time metrics — but the way it works is smarter than most people think.

Here’s what happens under the hood:
• The HPA controller watches the current metrics (CPU, memory, or custom).
• It compares them against the target value you configured.
• If usage is above the target → it increases replicas.
• If usage is below the target → it decreases replicas.
• All scaling decisions follow a stabilization window to avoid rapid fluctuations.

Where metrics come from:
• CPU/Memory → Metrics Server
• HTTP requests, queue length, latency → Custom Metrics API
• Any business metric → External Metrics API

Why HPA matters:
• Saves cost by scaling down during low usage
• Handles traffic spikes automatically
• Keeps your application responsive under load

In simple words:
HPA watches your app’s load and adjusts Pod counts so performance stays stable.
