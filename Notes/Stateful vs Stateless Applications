Stateful vs Stateless Applications
When you hear “stateful” or “stateless,” it may sound complicated. But it’s actually very simple if we use real-life examples.

1. What is a Stateless Application?
A stateless app does not store any data about previous requests.
Every request is independent.
You can kill or restart a Pod → no problem.
Scaling is easy because new Pods don’t need past information.

Example:
A simple web server that serves HTML pages
An API that calculates and returns a result based on input

Scenario:
You have 3 web server Pods behind a LoadBalancer
User 1 requests a page → served by Pod A
User 2 requests a page → served by Pod B
Pods can come and go → nothing breaks

Think of it like fast-food cashiers: they take an order, process it, and forget about it.

2. What is a Stateful Application?
A stateful app remembers past interactions.
Pod stores data or session info
Restarting a Pod may lose data if not handled properly

Scaling requires special mechanisms like Persistent Volumes or StatefulSets

Example:
Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL
Chat apps that track user sessions
E-commerce apps that track shopping carts

Scenario:
User adds items to cart → stored in a Pod
If Pod restarts without proper storage → cart is lost
Use Persistent Volumes or StatefulSets to keep data safe

Think of it like a bank teller: they need records of previous transactions to serve you correctly.
