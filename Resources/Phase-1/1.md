# Git and GitHub for Storing Manifests and Workflows in Kubernetes (K8s)

In Kubernetes (K8s), Git and GitHub are commonly used for versioning and storing Kubernetes manifests and workflows. Git provides a mechanism to track changes over time, collaborate with teams, and ensure that the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) philosophy is adhered to. GitHub adds collaboration features, code review, and CI/CD integrations.

## Introduction to Git & GitHub for Kubernetes

**Git** is a version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It's essential for tracking changes to Kubernetes manifests, which define the desired state of Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features like pull requests, issues, discussions, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

## Kubernetes Manifests

Kubernetes manifests are YAML files that describe the desired state of a Kubernetes cluster. They define resources like Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, and Persistent Volumes.

**Example Deployment manifest:**

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
