	There is a cluster, inside that one master node and multiple worker nodes are there.

Master Node:
--------------------------
	In master node, one api server is there and that helps in communication.
	Api server asks the scheduler to perform the tasks.
	Controller manager is there to manage the whole clusters.
	Etcd is there which is datastore.

Worker Node:
--------------------
	There is a kubelet which checks that all the pods are running or not.
	Pods contain containers and docker containers are running in that.
	Pods cant be directly accessed so for that we need service proxy.

Now whole communication will happen via network called CNI (Container Network Interface).

	Service proxy will talk with API server –
	API server will talk with scheduler, etcd and controller manager and kubelet.
	Kubectl will talk with API Server.
