Difference b/w Deployment and ReplicaSets: -

In deployment, we can do rolling updates, rollout, etc. 
Deployments are more flexible.
Deployments are more advanced. If ur system is getting updated, then all the replicas will not be getting updated at a time. It will happen slowly slowly like a rolling update.

In rs, we cant do all those things.
ReplicaSets are using the same technology that Deployment use.
Rolling updates are not there in ReplicaSets.
