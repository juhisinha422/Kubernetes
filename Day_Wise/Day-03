Today’s deep dive was all about workload management in Kubernetes:

ReplicaSets – Ensure your desired number of Pods are always running.
DaemonSets – Make sure a Pod is running on every node in the cluster.
Jobs – Execute a one-time task until completion, and terminate the pod once done.
CronJobs – Schedule Jobs to run periodically just like a Linux cron (perfect for backups, reports, or cleanup tasks)!

I’ve documented everything with CLI outputs and manifest files to reinforce hands-on learning.

Kubernetes is all about automation, scalability, and smart workload management. Every day brings a new layer of understanding!
