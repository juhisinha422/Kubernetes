Day-1 of Kubernetes

In day-1 of k8s I have explored how to create KIND (Kubernetes in docker) cluster means to run local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as nodes. It's lightweight, fast, and perfect for learning and testing! 

Why do we use namespace?
It helps to organize and isolate resources within a Kubernetes cluster. Think of them like folders useful for managing environments like dev, test, and prod within the same cluster.

What is the role of namespace?
We can have the same resource name (like a pod or service) in different namespaces without conflicts. Theyâ€™re essential for multi-team or multi-project environments in Kubernetes.
