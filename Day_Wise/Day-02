Kubernetes - Day 2 Highlights! 

Today, I deep-dived into some core Kubernetes concepts that are essential for anyone working with container orchestration:

ReplicaSets - Managing the desired number of pods

ReplicationController vs StatefulSets vs Deployments - Understanding their roles and use-cases

Labels & Selectors - Efficient resource management and filtering

Namespaces - Creating isolated environments for better resource handling

Pods - Crafting YAML files to spin up containers under a specific namespace

Rolling Updates - were I also for i ImagePullBackOff error anf resolved the same.

Included practical YAML to create a namespace, pod, deployment, Rolling updates making the learning hands-on and easy to apply in real-world clusters.

Tools used: kubectl, vim, and manifest files for Kubernetes deployments.
