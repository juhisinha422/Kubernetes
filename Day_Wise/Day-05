Kubernetes Day-5 | StatefulSets

Today, I explored a powerful Kubernetes workload resource StatefulSets while using Amazon Q to streamline and enhance the experience.

What I Did:

I deployed StatefulSets to manage stateful applications like databases and queues that require stable network identities, persistent storage, and ordered scaling/rolling updates.

Why StatefulSets?
Unlike Deployments, StatefulSets maintain a unique identity for each pod â€” perfect for apps like MySQL, Cassandra, or Kafka. It ensures pods are created and terminated in a specific order and each one retains its volume even after rescheduling.


Concepts Used:
Amazon Q CLI
Kubernetes StatefulSets
Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)
MCP (Managed Control Plane)

This was a great step forward in understanding how to manage stateful applications in Kubernetes.
