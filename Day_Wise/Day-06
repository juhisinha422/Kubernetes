Kubernetes Day-6

Diving into ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Resource Quotas! 

The essential components of Kubernetes configuration and resource management with Amazon Q and MCP servers:

ConfigMaps – For storing non-sensitive data like config files.
Secrets – For managing sensitive information like passwords and API keys securely.

Resource Quotas – Setting limits and requests to optimize pod scheduling and cluster resource utilization.

Taints and Tolerance - Control pod placement by preventing or allowing pods to be scheduled on specific nodes. This is useful for dedicated workloads, isolated environments, or workload prioritization.

Key takeaway: Efficient use of ConfigMaps and Secrets helps decouple configuration from application logic, while resource quotas help enforce stability and performance in the cluster.
