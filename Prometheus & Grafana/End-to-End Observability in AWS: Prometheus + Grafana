“End-to-End Observability in AWS: Prometheus + Grafana”
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 🛠️ Prometheus: The Data Collector
• Prometheus is like a thermometer for your systems.
• It collects real-time data (called metrics) from your applications and infrastructure.
• Examples: CPU usage, memory consumption, number of requests, error rates.
• It stores this data in a time-series format, so you can track changes over time.
📊 Grafana: The Dashboard Builder
Grafana is like a scoreboard that shows how your system is performing.
It takes the data from Prometheus and turns it into charts, graphs, and dashboards.
This helps you see trends, spot problems, and make decisions faster.

Explain this concept with cricket analogy for easy way to understand.
 In AWS DevOps, observability is the key to winning the reliability game.
Prometheus is the bowler — collecting metrics from EC2, EKS, ECS, and Lambda.
Alert manager is the umpire — raising flags when thresholds are breached.
Grafana is the batsman — turning raw data into dashboards and insights.
Your DevOps Team is the captain — making strategic decisions to keep systems resilient.
Together, they form a winning partnership for end-to-end monitoring in AWS.
