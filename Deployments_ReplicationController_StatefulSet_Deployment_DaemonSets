ReplicaSet vs StatefulSet vs Deployments vs DaemonSets
=============================================================

Replication Controller: manage pod replicas
ReplicaSet: create desired no of pods/replicas.
StatefulSet: gives numbering to the pods, pods state by sequence no will be maintained. Whatever replicas will be there, they state will be maintained.
DaemonSets ensures that on each node atleast one pod or replica should be running.
Deployment: whatever replicas are there they should do rolling updates, auto-scaling, auto-healing, etc.
