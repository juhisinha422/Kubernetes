Namespaces: -
+++++++++++++
Lets suppose: 
	We need to run docker container for nginx and it will run inside pod. A pod can have multiple containers. We need deployment for auto scaling, auto healing. We need to give access for application, so for that we will use service.
	Then only as a user we can access the app.

Namespace: -
++++++++++++++++++
	In K8S there is a groups which is called as namespace and here all the resources will be there.
 

$ mkdir Kubernetes
$ cd Kubernetes
$ kubectl get namespace 
$ kubectl get ns
 

	default: If u don’t create any namespaces then everything will go into this namespace, all the resources.
	kube-node-lease: nodes which are created that info will be stored here.
	kube-public: publicly accessible resources will be there
	kube-system: system level services are running here
	local-path-storage: for storage and one pod is running here also.

$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get ns
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system


# create namespace
$ kubectl create ns nginx
$ kubectl get ns
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
(pod/nginx created)
$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl delete pod nginx
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n nginx
$ kubectl get pods -n nginx
$ kubectl delete pod nginx -n nginx
$ kubectl delete ns nginx
