Preparing for a Kubernetes interview? Understanding Kustomize is essential for managing configurations across multiple environments! 🚀

1. What is Kustomize in Kubernetes?

Kustomize is a configuration management tool built into kubectl that customizes Kubernetes resource files using a kustomization.yaml file to define modifications without altering original manifests.

2. How does Kustomize differ from Helm?

Kustomize uses pure YAML with patches and overlays, while Helm relies on Go templating. Kustomize is template-free and integrated into kubectl, whereas Helm requires separate installation.

3. What are bases and overlays in Kustomize?

Bases contain common resource definitions shared across environments. Overlays apply environment-specific customizations on top of bases for dev, staging, and production deployments.

4. How do you create a kustomization.yaml file?

A kustomization.yaml file lists resources, defines namespace, and applies transformations. Include resources as YAML file paths and specify commonLabels for consistent labeling.

5. What are strategic merge patches and JSON patches?

Strategic merge patches intelligently merge fields based on Kubernetes schemas. JSON patches provide precise modifications using RFC 6902 operations for targeted field changes.

6. How do ConfigMap and Secret generators work?

Kustomize generates ConfigMaps and Secrets from files or literals. It automatically appends content hashes to names, triggering pod restarts when configurations change.

7. What are transformers in Kustomize?

Transformers systematically modify resources across all manifests, including commonLabels, commonAnnotations, namePrefix, nameSuffix, and namespace transformations.

8. How do you apply Kustomize configurations?

Use `kubectl apply -k <directory>` to apply configurations. Use `kubectl kustomize <directory>` to preview generated manifests before applying.

9. What are components in Kustomize?

Components are reusable configuration pieces selectively included in overlays, enabling modular configuration management across environments.

10. How do you manage multi-environment deployments?

Create a base directory with common resources and separate overlay directories for each environment, applying environment-specific patches for replicas and images.
