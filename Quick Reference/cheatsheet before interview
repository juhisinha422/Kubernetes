1. What k8s readiness prob do?
  Readiness probe checks whether pod is ready to serve  the traffic or not

ask from object like 
Pod
Service,
Deployment
PersistenVolumeClaim
ClusterConfig
ServiceMonitor  (for grafana)
HPA
ReplicaSet

then ask labels so pod can connect with each other by using labels

2. And how it is different from liveness prob
In Kubernetes, a Liveness Probe answers one critical question:
“Is this container still healthy, or is it stuck and needs a restart?”
If the answer is NO, Kubernetes kills and restarts the container.

Difference from readiness
Probe
Purpose
Failure result
Liveness
Is app stuck/dead?
Container restarted
Readiness
Can accept traffic?
Removed from Service

In real DevOps pipelines
You use:
Startup probe → Slow apps
Liveness probe → Crash recovery
Readiness probe → Zero-downtime traffic


3. In multicontainer pod how liveness and readiness probe work?
